• Fig. 39.1 Examples of genuine (A) and falsified (B) artemether-lumefantrine discovered in Africa. The red circles  indicate errors made by the criminals.The falsifiers confused‘m’ with ‘rn’ in‘lagern’ (German for “storing”)and  printed the packets with the word‘lagem’ in error. The falsified samples contained no detectable artemether or lume-fantrine but did contain subtherapeutic pyrimethamine.
