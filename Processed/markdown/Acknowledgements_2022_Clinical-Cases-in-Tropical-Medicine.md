# Page 1 Acknowledgements would like to thank the whole editorial team at Elsevier for their encouragement to go for the second edition of this book, for their tremendous support and patience. In partic-ular would like to thank content strategist Lotta Kryhl, con-tent development specialist Louise Cook, and Andrew Riley as project manager. am very grateful to all authors who come from 6 differ-ent continents, for their great enthusiasm and uncomplicated cooperation. am particularly obliged to all patients, whose cases are presented in this book, and some of whom sadly did not survive the diseases discussed. Special thanks go out to Anthony Harries who’s own wonderful case book, alas now out of print, inspired me to compile this current book. am particularly happy that Tony is one of the contributors of this book. I would like to thank David Lalloo for bringing me into contact with Elsevier. I am also very grateful and honoured that Peter Hotez volunteered to write a very special foreword to this book. xxi
