| Cause | Typical Onset and Course | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| Spinal tuberculosis | Insidious onset, chronically progressive over weeks, with months of back pain | Spasticity common, bladder may be spared, spinal deformity on examination |
| Spinal metastases | Subacute onset, chronically progressive over weeks | Spasticity or flaccidity, bladder may be spared |
| Transverse myelitis (incl. autoimmune) | Acute onset, often non-progressive | Bladder involvement common |
| Schistosomiasis | Acute (days) or subacute (a couple of weeks) | Often flaccid paresis, bladder involvement common |

| Cause | Diagnostic Clues | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Spinal tuberculosis | Typical spinal radiograph (see Box) Epidemiological evidence | Antituberculous treatment Spinal surgery if available and applicable (see Box) |
| Spinal metastases | Clinical evidence of the primary tumour (e.g. prostate, breast) | Very limited options: radiotherapy rarely available; corticosteroids to decrease oedema |
| Transverse myelitis (incl. autoimmune) | Young adults Inflammatory CSF | Corticosteroids |
| Schistosomiasis | Exposure to freshwater in endemic regions, young adults in endemic countries or non-immune travellers; CSF eosinophilia; other manifestations of schistosomiasis may or may not be present. | Praziquantel, corticosteroids |

| Complication | Prevention/Management |
|---|---|
| Pressure sores | Nursing, training and counselling of guardians (two hourly turning) |
| Urinary retention | Catheterization |
| Contractures | Physiotherapy, training of guardians for home-based physiotherapy |
| Pain | Pain relief by NSAID/opiates, involvement of local palliative care team |
| Immobilization | If available, prescription of walking aids/ wheelchairs |
