TABLE 28.2 Treatment of Loiasis Matched to Levels of Microfilaraemia (After Boussinesq 2012)
| Level of Microfilaraemia | Recommended Drug Regimen |
|---|---|
| High (>8000mfa/mL) | Albendazole 200mg bd for 21 days, followed by ivermectin 150μg/kg stat, then DEC at slowly increasing doses. |
| Moderate (2000-8000mf/mL) | Ivermectin 150 μg/kg stat, repeat after 1-3 months until microfilaraemia is <2000 mf/mL, this is followed by treatment with DEC. |
| Low (<2000mf/mL) | DEC: start with low doses of 3-6mg/d if there are parasites in the blood, 50 mg/d if amicrofilaraemic, divided into 2-3 doses. The dose is doubled every day up to 400mg/d, still divided into 2-3 doses. Start treatment in hospital. Oral antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful during the first days of treatment to reduce side effects (arthralgias, pruritus, headache, fever). Several 3-to 4-week courses of DEC administered at intervals of 2-3 weeks may be required to achieve a complete cure. |

mfa = microfilariae.
