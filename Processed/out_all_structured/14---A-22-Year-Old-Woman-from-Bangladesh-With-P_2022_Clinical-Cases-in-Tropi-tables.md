|                                | No Dehydration (<5%)                                                 | Some Dehydration (5-10%)                                                                             | Severe Dehydration (>10%)                                                                                                    |

| **Requirement for Fluid Replacement** | Ongoing losses only                                                  | 75mL/kg in the first 24 hours in addition to ongoing losses                                          | >100mL/kg in the first 24 hours in addition to ongoing losses                                                                |
| **Preferred Route of Administration** | Oral                                                                 | Oral or intravenous                                                                                  | Intravenous                                                                                                                  |
| **Timing**                     | Usually guided by thirst                                             | Replace fluids over 3-4 hours                                                                        | As rapidly as possible until circulation is restored, then complete the remainder of fluids within 3 hours                 |
| **Monitoring**                 | Observe until ongoing losses can definitely be adequately replaced by ORS | Observe every 1-2 hours until all signs of dehydration resolve and patient urinates                  | Once circulation is established monitor every 1-2 hours                                                                      |
