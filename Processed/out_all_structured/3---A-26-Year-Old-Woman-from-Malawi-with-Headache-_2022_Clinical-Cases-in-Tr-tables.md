TABLE 3.3 Clinical and CSF Features of Acute Bacterial, Tuberculous and Cryptococcal Meningitis
| Meningitis Type | Pathogen | Clinical Features | CSF Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acute Bacterial Meningitis | Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus suis (Asia) | Often very rapid onset with high fever and meningism, cranial nerve involvement less common | Often cloudy, high leukocyte cell count, predominance of polymorphs, low glucose |
| Tuberculous Meningitis | Mycobacterium tuberculosis | Often a history of several days of illness, onset less abrupt, cranial nerve involvement common | Often clear, high CSF protein, low CSF glucose |
| Cryptococcal Meningitis | Cryptococcus neoformans | Often subacute onset, severe headache common, cranial nerve involvement common | CSF can be normal in at least 25% of cases |

TABLE 3.1 Blood Results on Admission
| Parameter | Patient | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| WBC (10^9/L) | 3.2 | 4-10 |
| Hb (g/dL) | 10.2 | 12-14 |
| Platelets (10^9/L) | 155 | 150-350 |
| Serum glucose (mmol/L) | 4.0 | 3.9-11.1 |
| Thick film for malaria and trypanosomes | Negative | Negative |

TABLE 3.2 CSF Results on Admission
| Parameter | Patient | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| White cell count (/μL) | 54 | 0-5 |
| CSF protein (g/L) | 3.0 | 0.25-0.55 |
| CSF glucose (mmol/L) | 1.3 | 2.0-2.64∗ |

TABLE 3.4 The Four Pillars of Clinical Diagnosis of Tuberculous Meningitis
| Pillar | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Clinical Criteria | Symptom duration >5 days<br>Systemic symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (one or more of the following): weight loss (or poor weight gain in children), night sweats, or persistent cough for more than 2 weeks<br>History of close contact with an individual with pulmonary tuberculosis or a positive tuberculin skin test within the past year<br>Focal neurological deficit<br>Cranial nerve palsy<br>Altered consciousness |
| CSF Criteria | Clear appearance<br>Leukocytes: 10-500/μL<br>Lymphocytic predominance (>50%)<br>Protein concentration >1g/L<br>CSF to plasma-glucose ratio <50% or absolute CSF glucose concentration <2.2mmol/L |
| Neuroimaging Criteria | Hydrocephalus<br>Basal meningeal enhancement<br>Tuberculoma<br>Infarct<br>Pre-contrast basal hyperdensity |
| Evidence of TB Elsewhere | Chest radiography suggestive of active TB<br>Evidence for TB outside the CNS on CT, MRI or ultrasound<br>AFB identified or M. tuberculosis cultured from another source (sputum, lymph node, gastric washing, urine, blood culture)<br>Positive commercial M. tuberculosis-PCR from extraneural specimen |
