The dose is doubled every day up to 400mg/d, still divided into 2-3 doses. Start treatment in hospital. Oral antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful during the first days of treatment to reduce side effects (arthralgias, pruritus, headache, fever). Several 3-to 4-week courses of DEC administered at intervals of 2-3 weeks may be required to achieve a complete cure. |",
