Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arbo-viral infection, which is also in line with the putative incu-bation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chi-kungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much 214 # Page 2 of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduc-tion, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years. Acute dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections have similar presentations and may be clinically indistinguishable. However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1).",
        "Complications in measles are much more common in indi-viduals with cellular immune defects than in the immuno-competent. Severe diarrhoea, septicaemia, giant cell pneumonia, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, encephali-tis, otitis media and corneal ulcerations can complicate the course of disease. In this case, with a reduced Blantyre Coma Scale and laboured breathing, encephalitis and pulmonary involvement have to be considered. Because the rash in this boy has only just appeared, he is still contagious and needs to be isolated and nursed in a separate room. 85 # Page 2 The Case Continued\u2026 The boy required fluids, and vitamin was given for cor-neal protection. Malaria treatment was stopped as smears turned out to be negative. Within the next 3 days, the rash covered the trunk and skin scaling started over the chest (Fig. 31.1). The boy developed severe pneumonia and received antibiotic treatment. After recovery, antiretroviral therapy was started in the out-patient-clinic. Measles Measles is a highly contagious viral infection, caused by a para-myxovirus and transmitted through droplets. The course of the disease is strongly influenced by both nutritional and immune status of the affected individual. Despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, large measles outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. After an incu-bation period of 8 to 12 days, the non-specific prodromal stage presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and cough, followed after a few days by a maculopapular rash, evolving behind the ears and in the face, spreading over the trunk and limbs.",
        "Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days\u2019 duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery. Dengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these methods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral blood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed, (at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however, cross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, espe-cially in Zika endemic areas. Warning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increas-ing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytope-nia, six of which were present in this case. With no antiviral treatment available, cautious intravascular volume replacement and supportive treatment are the mainstays of management, accompanied by careful monitoring for signs of fluid overload. In many countries the epidemiology of dengue is changing in line with aging populations.",

        "Serological and PCR tests are available for the diagnosis of Lassa fever, and antigen-based rapid point-of-care tests have been licensed, although more testing on the sensitivity for dif-ferent strains is needed. Because Lassa fever is common, it should be considered in anyone with an unexplained febrile condition who has visited an endemic area within the past 21 days and appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented. It is more common in people from rural than urban areas, but it does occur in towns. Treatment with IV ribavirin is likely to be beneficial if given early in the disease, but it should also be considered in patients who are diagnosed late.

Is viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) a real risk, and which single test is the most important? Discussion young womanpresents with a fever, jaundice and confusion almost 3 weeks after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The patient is of African ethnicity but was born in Europe. Answer to Question 1 What is the Differential Diagnosis? The differential diagnosis is wide, but by some distance the most common cause of fever and jaundice or fever and con-fusion in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. The fact that the patient had a low-grade fever at presentation is not a reason to exclude malaria, because the temperature swings in malaria and a significant proportion of cases are apyrexial at presentation.",
        "Her family members, close friends and medical staff were interviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her, or her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for 21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum incubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever or became unwell during this period was isolated. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are both caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-guishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate. Symptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and abdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-quent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die develop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Because symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in most of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an outbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should raise the suspicion towards FHF. EVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of MHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines, whereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating apes or monkeys."

Dur-ing the second week of his stay he developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash started on the forearms about 1 week after the onset of fever and spread to the trunk, neck and face before fading after 3 days. In addition, there were slowly progressive debilitating polyarthralgias affecting the peripheral joints accompanied by transient joint swelling. He also noticed painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, which was self-limiting, lasting for about 1 week. The traveller presented at the local hospital, where physi-cians made a clinical diagnosis of dengue fever, and he received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol. Although the fever and the other symptoms subsided within 1 week, the polyarthralgias did not improve, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return home to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient consulted his general practitioner because of persist-ing, incapacitating polyarthralgias. The patient reported stiff-ness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility. Physical examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation (swelling, red-ness, effusion).",

What clinical features can be used to establish an aetiolo-gical diagnosis of infectious diarrhoea in the tropics? 2. What complications can result from an acute enteric infection? Discussion 33-year-old Finnish traveller to India presents with passage of loose stools, four or five episodes a day for the past 2 weeks. The stools have become greasy and foul-smelling, and he has bloating and distension after consumption of milk or milk products. The presence of reducing substances in the stool indicates a carbohydrate malabsorption, most likely of post-infectious origin. Answer to Question 1 What Clinical Features Can be Used to Establish an Aetiological Diagnosis of Infectious Diarrhoea in the Tropics? In the absence of a laboratory, clinical features sometimes provide a clue to the cause of infectious diarrhoea (Table 49.1). Diarrhoea caused by small intestinal infection is typically high volume, watery and often associated with malabsorption and dehydration. Colonic involvement is more often associated with frequent small-volume stools, the presence of blood and a sensation of urgency. Chronic diarrhoea or recurrent episodes of acute diarrhoea should prompt testing. Answer to Question 2 What Complications Can Result from an Acute Enteric Infection?",

        "\u03b2-thalassaemia, commonly seen in tropical countries, also presents with microcytic anaemia and should be considered if there is no response to iron supplementation. In \u03b2-thalassaemia the so-called Mentzer index (MCV [fL] : Erythrocyte count [ 1012/L]) is typically below 13; in iron deficiency it is above 13. Intestinal helminth infection can contribute to anaemia. Because reliable stool microscopy may not be feasible in a resource-constrained setting, pragmatic anthelmintic treat-ment appears justifiable. Vitamin B3 (niacin) should be sup-plemented and it should be evaluated how the family\u2019s diet could be improved despite their poor socioeconomic circum-stances. A simple affordable trick is to advise the patient to eat some of the maize directly from the cob, because it is the husks that harbour tryptophan and that go lost during preparation of white maize flour.

        "The ulcer is painless unless there is bacterial superinfection. Patients may have several lesions. Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimor-phic fungus that is found in soil and on plants. It enters the skin through direct inoculation (e.g. thorny plants or animal scratch). The disease usually starts with a papule that turns into a tender ulcer. Lesions can spread along draining lym-phatic vessels. Sporotrichosis occurs throughout the world as a sporadic disease of farmers and gardeners. This disease is hyperendemic in parts of the Peruvian Andes, where it often affects children and typically produces facial lesions. 4 # Page 2 However, our patient did not travel to such a hyper-endemic place. Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon manifestation of tuberculosis. It occurs by direct inoculation of mycobacteria into the skin of non-sensitized individuals (e.g. children) or as a result of reactivation in persons with previous immunity against mycobacteria. As our patient lives in a poor neighbour-hood with a high incidence of tuberculosis, we cannot rule out this diagnosis. Not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium leprae can cause ulcerating skin lesions. mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that may cause a highly fatal disease.

        "Not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium leprae can cause ulcerating skin lesions. mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that may cause a highly fatal disease. It usually starts as a painless plaque, often after local trauma. Balamuthia lesions are characterized by reddish or purplish infiltrations; ulceration is uncommon. The most frequent location of the initial lesion is the central face, over the nose. In a few months, it can progress to the brain causing granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. If this occurs, the survival time is usually less than 8 weeks. The most likely diagnosis in our case is cutaneous leish-maniasis, because of the frequency of leishmaniasis in the val-ley our patient had travelled to and the characteristic presentation (localized painless ulcer with raised edges). Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach This Patient? Gently clean the lesion with water, remove the scab and take a closer look at the process underneath. definitive diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis requires the demonstration of the parasite through microscopic examination, culture or molec-ular techniques. The simplest approach is to scrape with a lancet under the edges of the lesion, and use the obtained material for a smear examination with Giemsa staining, looking for Leishmania amastigotes. The sensitivity of this technique is about 70%, decreasing as the duration of the lesion increases.",

General symptoms are limited to a mildly elevated temperature. Answer to Question 1 What is the Most Likely Diagnosis and What is the Differential Diagnosis? The geographical region of West Africa, the young age of the patient, the location of the lesion on the extremities, the absence of major trauma and the clinical picture lead to a sus-pected diagnosis diagnosis of Buruli ulcer (BU). The history of an insect bite is an incidental finding, the mode of trans-mission of the causative organism, Mycobacterium ulcerans, remains unknown. Pain and low-grade fever as seen in this case may also be explained by bacterial superinfection.

        "In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango fly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy ground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on a clothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents. Humans become infected when lying on the ground or wearing contami-nated clothes without prior hot ironing. Larvae hatch and burrow into the skin. Over the following 2 to 3 weeks the developing larvae cause an itchy and at times painful \u2018blind boil.\u2019 Lesions are usually sterile because of bacteriostatic substances produced in the larvae\u2019s guts. Treatment aims to deprive the larvae of oxygen, which prompts them to extrude from the skin. This can be achieved by applying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin on the lesion to block their respiratory spiracles. Immature larvae are best left to develop for a while because they are difficult to retrieve, and maceration of the larva can lead to inflammation and superinfection. Even untreated, cutaneous myiasis is self-limiting because the mature larva has to leave the host and pupate elsewhere. In Central and South America, myiasis is caused by Derma-tobia hominis, the human botfly (Fig. 8.2). Unlike the Tumbu fly, this species lays its eggs directly on exposed skin. Furthermore, it deposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, flies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a technique called \u2018hitch-hiking.\u2019 Removal of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision."

        "This finding emphasizes an emerging concept in tropical medicine that many parasitic and related infections occur outside of the poorest countries, with high levels of transmission also occurring in generally wealthy countries such as in the or Eastern and Southern Europe.7,8 The term \u2018blue marble health\u2019 has been coined to account for the finding that many of the world\u2019s neglected tropical diseases are found predominantly among the extreme poor living amidst wealth.9 In other words, poverty has emerged as the overriding social determinant of neglected tropical dis-eases. But poverty is not the only social or physical determi-nant now driving 21st century diseases, as increasingly, we increasingly see how war or political collapse, urbanization, and climate change influence disease patterns10-12. Clinical Cases in Tropical Medicine (\u2018Clinical Cases\u2019) is a key companion volume to the 23rd Edition of Manson\u2019s Tropical Diseases, but it will also be useful alongside other complete tropical medicine textbooks.

The rate of fluid delivery is subsequently reduced to 7mL/kg/hr for 2 hours and by a further 2mL/kg/hr every 2 hours until no longer required. Repeat clinical assessments are undertaken at two-hourly intervals throughout, with hae-matocrit checks every 6 hours. The patient is discharged from hospital 3 days later, after complete recovery. Reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and a positive NS1 ELISA confirm dengue diagnosis. SUMMARY BOX Dengue Dengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect humans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million infections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus family and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosqui-toes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive temperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in Europe and North America. Although most clinically apparent infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority progress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding, capillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days\u2019 duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery."

        "Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environ-mental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums where basic infrastructure is not available and rural and urban areas in endemic countries where sanitation is limited, including refugee camps. Additionally, natural disasters, as well as times of political and social unrest associated with a collapse of infrastructure, pose a risk of cholera. An outbreak is defined as the occurrence of disease epi-sodes in greater numbers than would be expected at a partic-ular time and place. In this case there seems to be a typical cholera outbreak. The source is most probably contaminated water consumed from the containers during the festival, with the likelihood that unless control measures for disease prevention and appropriate case management are instituted rapidly, there will be spread, significant morbidity and, possibly, mortality. Answer to Question 2 How is Dehydration Assessed and Managed? The WHO has recommended an assessment based on the general clinical condition of the patient (Table 14.2). Depending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are assigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration or intravenous rehydration (Table 14.3). Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement are the corner-stones of cholera management and differ substantially from the approaches to patients with gastroenteritis of other aeti-ologies. Patients with severe cholera present with a higher CHAPTER 14 A 22-Year-Old Woman from Bangladesh With Profuse Watery Diarrhoea # Page 3 degree of initial dehydration, have more rapid continuing losses and proportionately greater electrolyte depletion than patients with other forms of gastroenteritis.",

Her husband reports that shebecameunresponsiveaboutanhourpreviouslyandhehired a rickshaw to bring her to the hospital. He says that she had not complained of pain and did not have fever. The patient has recently attended a religious festival, where water was supplied in large metal containers. Her hus-band reports that there were five or six people who had attended the same event and were also ill with diarrhoea. Clinical Findings thin young woman, who is stuporous and responds min-imally to a painful stimulus (GCS 9/15). She is afebrile, with sunken eyes, dry mouth and a scaphoid abdomen. skin pinch returns very slowly. Her pulse rate is 110bpm, low vol-ume, and her blood pressure is 90/50mmHg.

        "cholerae and asymptomatic carriage is possible. The main source of trans-mission is from a contaminated water source. In some parts of the world, copepods are responsible for maintaining Vibrio spp. in a viable but non-cultivable state. The incubation period ranges between 12 hours and 5 days. Patients are usually afebrile and do not have any abdominal pain. The major clinical challenge is dehydration, ranging from mild to severe, and electrolyte imbalance leading on to renal failure in severe cases. In epidemics, the diagnosis of cholera may be presumptive on clinical and epidemiological grounds following the WHO clinical case definition. Laboratory confirmation may be required when sporadic cases occur or when an extensive outbreak requires confirmation and typing of the etiological agent. Treatment typically involves isolation of the patient, correction of dehydration and antimicrobial treatment. In most cases oral replacement solutions may be used. Antimicrobial therapy is secondary; it is shown to decrease shedding of the bacteria and also hastens clinical resolution of illness. Tetracycline and doxy-cycline are the preferred drugs in adults, but ciprofloxacin or macrolides can also be used depending on availability and local resistance pattern. Public health measures to improve water and sanitation are essential for long-term control. WHO has endorsed the inclusion of oral vaccines in cholera control programmes in endemic areas in conjunction with other preventive and control strategies.",
        "Stool examination for enteric parasites: Giardia trophozoites are seen in the fresh specimen. Giardia cysts are detected on formol-ether con-centrated specimens (Fig. 49.1). Questions 1. What clinical features can be used to establish an aetiolo-gical diagnosis of infectious diarrhoea in the tropics? 2. What complications can result from an acute enteric infection? Discussion 33-year-old Finnish traveller to India presents with passage of loose stools, four or five episodes a day for the past 2 weeks. The stools have become greasy and foul-smelling, and he has bloating and distension after consumption of milk or milk products. The presence of reducing substances in the stool indicates a carbohydrate malabsorption, most likely of post-infectious origin. Answer to Question 1 What Clinical Features Can be Used to Establish an Aetiological Diagnosis of Infectious Diarrhoea in the Tropics? In the absence of a laboratory, clinical features sometimes provide a clue to the cause of infectious diarrhoea (Table 49.1). Diarrhoea caused by small intestinal infection is typically high volume, watery and often associated with malabsorption and dehydration. Colonic involvement is more often associated with frequent small-volume stools, the presence of blood and a sensation of urgency. Chronic diarrhoea or recurrent episodes of acute diarrhoea should prompt testing. Answer to Question 2 What Complications Can Result from an Acute Enteric Infection?",
        "Patients with severe cholera present with a higher CHAPTER 14 A 22-Year-Old Woman from Bangladesh With Profuse Watery Diarrhoea # Page 3 degree of initial dehydration, have more rapid continuing losses and proportionately greater electrolyte depletion than patients with other forms of gastroenteritis. The most com-mon error is for clinicians to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required for rehydration. Up to 80% of sufferers can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration salts (WHO/ UNICEF ORS standard sachets). In adults, 2 to 4 litres of ORS may be required in the first 4 hours. Patients with severe cholera typically require an average of 200mL/kg of isotonic oral or IV fluids in the first 24 hours (Table 14.2). The initial fluid deficit should be replaced within 3 to 4 hours of initial presentation. 10 to 20mL/kg bodyweight should be calculated for each diarrhoeal stool or episode of vomiting. Antibiotic therapy in cholera is secondary; but in patients with severe disease, appropriate antibiotics diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excre-tion. In Bangladesh, resistance to furazolidone and tetracy-cline is increasing. The Case Continued\u2026 The patient was admitted immediately and started on intra-venous rehydration with Ringer\u2019s lactate solution. After receiving 3L in the first hour her pulse rate and blood pres-sure picked up to 84bpm and 100/70mmHg respectively."
