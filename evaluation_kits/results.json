The patient isa Sudaneserefugee living inacampintheregion.Shedeniesanycontactwithsickpeople. Clinical Findings The patient is prostrate and semiconscious on admission. Vital signs: temperature 39.6°C, (103.3°F) blood pressure 90/60mmHg, pulse 90bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Physical examination revealed abdominal ten-derness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosple-nomegaly and bleeding from the gums. The lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted. Questions 1. Is the patient’s history and clinical presentation consistent with a haemorrhagic fever (HF) syndrome? 2. What degree of nursing precautions need to be implemented? Discussion This patient was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus dis-ease in northern Uganda, so the diagnosis was strongly sus-pected. She was admitted to the isolation ward that had been established as part of the international outbreak response. No clinical laboratory data were available because, for biosafety reasons, such testing was suspended. Although it is a reasonable precaution, the suspension of routine testing often causes difficulty in ruling out the many other febrile syn-dromes in the differential diagnosis and increases mortality from other non-Ebola disease.",
        "Infection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific febrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history of diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild splenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients, hepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with iNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection, with pathogens such as M. tuberculosis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection. Blood culture remains the diagnostic standard; however, it is not widely available in many African settings. Also, sensitivity of blood culture is suboptimal because of the low magnitude of bacteraemia (median <1 CFU/mL). Care should therefore be taken to inoculate large enough volumes of blood for culture. Antimicrobial resistance among iNTS strains in Africa is increasing. Empirical management is similar to enteric fever and includes either a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, depending on the local resistance pattern and drug availability. If oral intake is not possible, a third-generation cephalosporin should be administered. Effective antibiotic treatment should be given for 10 to 14 days. Antiretroviral therapy should be started urgently to prevent relapse. The case fatality rate of patients with iNTS is much higher than in enteric fever (22-47% vs 1%).",

        "Given the bleeding tendency seen in the wife, most viral haemorrhagic fevers can be excluded based on the incuba-tion time alone, which is well below 21 days for most endemic viral haemorrhagic fevers (yellow fever, dengue and the New World arenaviruses, e.g. Junín virus and Machupo virus). There is only one exception to this rule, which is hantavirus infections: their incubation time may be up to 35 days. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage These Patients Clinically? Is There Any Need to Consider Particular Hospital Hygiene Precautions? Both patients should be referred to a tertiary care setting, which is equipped to handle ARDS and haemorrhagic fevers. Clinically, securing cardiorespiratory function is the main priority. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated as empir-ical treatment until further results are back. Although the aetiology is still unclear, a patient with respi-ratory symptoms must be treated under standard hygiene and droplet precautions (at least) to prevent potential noso-comial transmission.

        "Laboratory testing at a specialized laboratory established as part of the outbreak response showed positive antigen and tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for ELISA IgG antibody, confirming the diagnosis of Ebola virus disease. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Ebola and Marburg virus disease are the two syndromes caused by filoviruses. Microvascular instability with capillary leak and impaired haemostasis, often including disseminated intravascular coagulation, are the pathogenic hallmarks. There are four known pathogenic species of Ebola and one of Marburg virus, with rel-atively consistent case fatality associated with each species, ranging from 25% to 85%. Ebola and Marburg diseases are generally indistinguishable, both with non-specific presentations typically including fever, headache, asthenia, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Conjunctival injection and subconjunctival haemorrhage are common. A fleeting maculo-papular rash is occasionally seen. Typical laboratory findings include mild lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic transaminases, with AST>ALT. Leucocytosis may be seen in late stages. The differential diagnosis is extremely broad, including almost all febrile diseases common in the tropics. Ebola and Marburg virus diseases are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with Ebola virus typically found in tropical rain-forests in the central and western parts of the continent and Marburg virus in the drier forest or savannah in the east.",
        "No clinical laboratory data were available because, for biosafety reasons, such testing was suspended. Although it is a reasonable precaution, the suspension of routine testing often causes difficulty in ruling out the many other febrile syn-dromes in the differential diagnosis and increases mortality from other non-Ebola disease. Fortunately, many clinical lab-oratory tests can now be safely performed with point-of-care instruments, often brought into a specialized laboratory in the isolation ward, as long as the laboratory personnel are properly trained and equipped. Answer to Question 1 Is the Patient’s History and Clinical Presentation Consistent with an Syndrome? The clinical presentation is indeed one of classic viral However, most times the diagnosis is not so easy. Although some patients, such as this one, do progress to the classic syn-drome with haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syn-drome and shock, haemorrhage is not invariably seen (and may even be noted in only a minority of cases with some virus species), and severe and fatal disease may still occur in its absence. The clinical presentation of viral is often very non-specific. Furthermore, haemorrhage may be seen in numerous other syndromes, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis and leptospirosis, which are the primary differential diagnoses, depending on the region.

        "A hae-morrhagic course may occur, although uncommon. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology, either with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. There is no specific treatment or vaccine against ANDV. The use of ribavirin and corticosteroids in ANDV infection still remains to be elucidated. Organ supportive therapy is therefore the mainstay of treatment. Patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infec-tion, because ECMO support might be required. Case fatality rate in patients with HCPS attributable to ANDV is 20% to 40%. ANDV is the only hantavirus for which person-to-person transmission has been described, though this occurs very rarely. Nosocomial outbreaks were first reported in 1995. The incubation period in such a scenario is usually around 20 days. Person-to-person transmission is much less common than infection by inhalation of rodent excreta and occurs through close interpersonal contacts in the hospital setting (caring for a person with respiratory or haemorrhagic symptoms) or at home (such as sexual contacts, deep kissing or sharing the same bed). In the nosocomial setting, standard hygiene and droplet precautions should be adopted, and it is recommended to treat the patients in a single room. During aerosol-generating pro-cedures, however, healthcare workers are advised to wear high-efficiency respirator masks and ocular protection.",

        "Dengue NS1 and dengue IgM should be performed (because NS1 might have turned negative after more than 1 week of illness).

If available, PCR of urine and blood should be done to look for leptospirosis; microscopic agglutination test is an alternative if PCR is not available. Laboratory tests should include IgM antibodies for the different viral hepatitis viruses (except for acute hepatitis D because of delayed antibody production).
