TABLE 3.3 Clinical and CSF Features of Acute Bacterial, Tuberculous and Cryptococcal Meningitis Bacterial Pathogen Clinical Features CSF Features Acute Bacterial Meningitis Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus suis (Asia) Often very rapid onset with high fever and meningism, cranial nerve involvement less common Often cloudy, high leukocyte cell count, predominance of polymorphs, low glucose Tuberculous Meningitis Mycobacterium tuberculosis Often a history of several days of illness, onset less abrupt, cranial nerve involvement common Often clear, high CSF protein, low CSF glucose Cryptococcal Meningitis Cryptococcus neoformans Often subacute onset, severe headache common, cranial nerve involvement common CSF can be normal in at least 25% of cases

TABLE 3.4 The Four Pillars of Clinical Diagnosis of Tuberculous Meningitis Clinical Criteria Symptom duration >5 days Systemic symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (one or more of the following): weight loss (or poor weight gain in children), night sweats, or persistent cough for more than 2 weeks History of close contact with an individual with pulmonary tuberculosis or a positive tuberculin skin test within the past year Focal neurological deficit Cranial nerve palsy Altered consciousness CSF Criteria Clear appearance Leukocytes: 10-500/μL Lymphocytic predominance (>50%) Protein concentration >1g/L CSF to plasma-glucose ratio <50% or absolute CSF glucose concentration <2.2mmol/L Neuroimaging Criteria Hydrocephalus Basal meningeal enhancement Tuberculoma Infarct Pre-contrast basal hyperdensity Evidence of TB Elsewhere Chest radiography suggestive of active TB Evidence for TB outside the CNS on CT, MRI or ultrasound AFB identified or M. tuberculosis cultured from another source (sputum, lymph node, gastric washing, urine, blood culture) Positive commercial M. tuberculosis-PCR from extraneural specimen Footnote: Marais, S., Thwaites, G., Schoeman, J.F., etal., 2010.
