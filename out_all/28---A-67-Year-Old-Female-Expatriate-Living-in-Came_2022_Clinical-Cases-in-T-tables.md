TABLE 28.2 Treatment of Loiasis Matched to Levels of Microfilaraemia (After Boussinesq 2012) Level of Microfilaraemia Recommended Drug Regimen High (>8000mfa/mL) Albendazole 200mg bd for 21 days, followed by ivermectin 150μg/kg stat, then DEC at slowly increasing doses. Moderate (2000-8000mf/mL) Ivermectin 150 μg/kg stat, repeat after 1-3 months until microfilaraemia is <2000 mf/mL, this is followed by treatment with DEC. Low (<2000mf/mL) DEC: start with low doses of 3-6mg/d if there are parasites in the blood, 50 mg/ d if amicrofilaraemic, divided into 2-3 doses. The dose is doubled every day up to 400mg/d, still divided into 2-3 doses. Start treatment in hospital. Oral antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful during the first days of treatment to reduce side effects (arthralgias, pruritus, headache, fever). Several 3-to 4-week courses of DEC administered at intervals of 2-3 weeks may be required to achieve a complete cure. mfa ¼ microfilariae. 77
