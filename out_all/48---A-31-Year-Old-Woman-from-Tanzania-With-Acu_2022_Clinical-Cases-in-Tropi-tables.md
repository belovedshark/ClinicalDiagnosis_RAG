TABLE 48.4 Pathophysiology of Acute Transverse Myelitis Pathophysiology Treatment Idiopathic, (majority of the cases) Presumably an autoimmune phenomenon Might be a manifestation of a chronic autoimmune demyelinating CNS disease (such as NMO and multiple sclerosis) Corticosteroids against inflammation Associated with infection Direct invasion of the spinal cord by microorganisms Causative treatment e.g. acyclovir for VZV myelitis Autoimmune phenomenon as a result of infection elsewhere (“parainfectious”) Might be associated with vaccination against the microorganism Corticosteroids against inflammation Associated with a systemic autoimmune disorder Autoimmune phenomenon Often the autoimmune disorder (e.g. lupus or secondary vasculitis) in the patient is already known Corticosteroids against inflammation 134
