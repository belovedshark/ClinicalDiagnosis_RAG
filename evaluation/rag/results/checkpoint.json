        "Discussion Six days after returning from a 2-week holiday to Guate-mala and El Salvador, a 51-year-old female Swiss traveller presents with a slightly pruritic disseminated maculo-papular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees and feet) and a generalized lym-phadenopathy. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arbo-viral infection, which is also in line with the putative incu-bation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chi-kungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much 214 # Page 2 of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduc-tion, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years. Acute dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections have similar presentations and may be clinically indistinguishable. However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1).",

        "# Page 18727-Year-Old Male Traveller Returning from the Peruvian Amazon With Persisting Polyarthralgias Clinical Presentation History 27-year-old male Swiss tourist spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. Dur-ing the second week of his stay he developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash started on the forearms about 1 week after the onset of fever and spread to the trunk, neck and face before fading after 3 days. In addition, there were slowly progressive debilitating polyarthralgias affecting the peripheral joints accompanied by transient joint swelling. He also noticed painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, which was self-limiting, lasting for about 1 week. The traveller presented at the local hospital, where physi-cians made a clinical diagnosis of dengue fever, and he received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol. Although the fever and the other symptoms subsided within 1 week, the polyarthralgias did not improve, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return home to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient consulted his general practitioner because of persist-ing, incapacitating polyarthralgias. The patient reported stiff-ness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility. Physical examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation (swelling, red-ness, effusion).",

He thinks he might have been bitten on his ankle by a tick 2 days previously while out walk-ing in the countryside. Twenty-four hours after this event he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on the inside of his left ankle and this was accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He went to a clinic where a blood film for malaria parasites was reported negative. He was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a wide-spread itchy rash and shortly afterwards became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint. There was a family history of allergy. He had kept bees in the United Kingdom and had frequently been stung without ill effect. However, 9 months previously he had been bitten by insects while at Lake Malawi and had developed an asthmatic attack which resolved spontaneously over 2 days. Clinical Findings On examination, he is clammy, in a state of collapse and has a widespread urticarial rash. There is respiratory distress and stridor. There is an indurated circumscribed swelling on the inside of his left ankle (Fig. 78.1). His vital signs are: temperature 38°C, pulse rate 130 bpm, systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg.",

There is also a productive cough with whitish sputum that started 1 day before the rash appeared, and she also reports a sore throat and dysuria for the past 2 days. The patient had been found to be positive 2 months earlier, when she was hospitalized with cryptoco-ccal meningitis. She was treated with high-dose oral fluco-nazole, because amphotericin and flucytosine were unavailable. She improved and was discharged home on a maintenance dose of fluconazole. Antiretroviral treatment with stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP), as well as co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, were started 1 month previously. The rest of the medical history is unremarkable and there are no known allergies. Clinical Findings Her temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure 120/68mmHg, pulse 90 bpm and respiratory rate 24 breath cycles per minute.

        "Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’ duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery. Dengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these methods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral blood.

        "Enteric fever, an important disease in low-income tropical countries, can cause confusion and should be considered, but the rate of disease progression in this case is uncharacteristic. Dengue fever is endemic in South-east Asia and should also be con-sidered. Skin changes in dengue usually present with tran-sient flushing erythema of the face followed by a diffuse erythematous, blanching rash on days 3 to 6. A small propor-tion of patients develop severe disease during a second, immune-mediated phase (usually on day 4-6). This phase may be complicated by capillary leak, shock, mucocutaneous bleeding and organ involvement. Dengue may also present as encephalitis. In this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningi-tis and shock is not typical for dengue. Melioidosis is another differential diagnosis to consider. In some areas of South-east Asia, it is the commonest cause of community-acquired sepsis, and diabetes is known to be a risk factor for the disease. Melioidosis may also cause brain abscess and encephalitis. However, melioidosis is compara-tively rare in Vietnam, where the true burden of disease remains to be elucidated.

SUMMARY BOX Dengue Dengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect humans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million infections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus family and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosqui-toes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive temperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in Europe and North America. Although most clinically apparent infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority progress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding, capillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’ duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery.",

        "Adult L. loa migrate through the subcutaneous and connective tissues of the human body. Migration may cause urticaria and transient painless subcutane-ous swellings (‘Calabar swellings’), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, which is noticed by the patient as intense itching of the eye, pain and photophobia. Passage of the palpebral conjunctiva is associated with swelling of the eyelid and the periorbital region. Loiasis may cause renal complications (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) and a wide range of neurological symptoms. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae that are detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime with a peak around noon, but are usually absent at night. This diurnal periodicity corresponds to the day-biting habits of the Chrysops vectors. Microfilaraemia in L. loa infection tends to be higher than in lymphatic filariasis, where microfilariaemia is usually betweeen 1 and 1000 mf/ml. However, there is also a high percentage of amicrofilaraemic individuals (‘occult loiasis’) in endemic areas, which poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis in loiasis relies on the typical passage of the adults through the bulbar conjunctiva (‘eye worm’).",

She has just returned from a 6-week trip to Ghana. The swelling has developed slowly over the past 3 weeks. It is itchy, but not painful. There is no history of fever; no history of arthropod bites. The patient is otherwise fine. Clinical Findings There is localized swelling on the left leg, about 1.5cm in diameter (Fig. 8.1). The skin surrounding the swelling is slightly hyperaemic. The boil is covered by a blackish scab. There is no lymphadenopathy. The patient is afebrile while the rest of the physical examination is normal. Questions 1. What are your most important differential diagnoses? 2. How would you approach this patient? Discussion young traveller presents with a localized swelling on her leg after backpacking in Ghana. The swelling has been growing slowly and there are no systemic signs or symptoms. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Most Important Differential Diagnoses? There is a localized swelling with a central scab. This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process. Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely.",
        "It may however take some time for the pathognomonic eschar to demarcate and early lesions may be non-specific erythematous papules, resembling mosquito bites. Multiple inoculation eschars are not uncommon, because Amblyomma ticks are known to aggressively attack their hosts. Despite the fact that African tick-bite fever belongs to the group of ‘spotted fevers’, a rash is seen in less than half of cases. ATBF is usually a mild illness and no deaths have been reported so far. However, neurological involvement has been described in ATBF, including encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Also, retinitis and panuveitis have been described. Diagnosis of ATBF is usually made clinically, but in febrile individuals living in or returning from tropical areas malaria should still be ruled out. PCR from the eschar scab or even a skin swab is a non-invasive and sensitive way to confirm the diagnosis of acute infection. Serodiagnosis remains the gold standard for spotted-fever group rickettsial infections using seroconversion and fourfold antibody titre increases. Its use in clinical decision-making is however limited because of poor sensitivity during acute infection (antibodies are often not detectable within the first 10-14 days), the indirect nature of diagnostic evidence and cross-reaction with other Rickettsiae. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is currently considered the gold standard serological test. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases.",

The virus is a member of the flavivirus family and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosqui-toes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive temperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in Europe and North America. Although most clinically apparent infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority progress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding, capillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’ duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery.",
        "Discussion The short duration of symptoms before presentation is sug-gestive of an acute infective process, and the relatively low and absence of neutrophil leucocytosis make a viral aetiology likely. Clinical signs of shock are present: tachycar-dia, narrow pulse pressure (<20 mmHg), reduced and raised serum lactate. The degree of thrombocytopenia and presence of hepatic impairment are important markers of dis-ease severity, and his raised haematocrit level is suggestive of haemoconcentration. What are the main differential diagnoses to consider? Having presented in a high-endemicity area, the clinical pic-ture is typical of dengue infection with apparent progression to severe disease with vascular leak and compensated shock. Even without an eschar, rickettsial infections, such as scrub typhus, are the most important differential diagnoses. Malaria should also be considered, but there is no evidence of haemolysis to support this, and risk of malaria is very low in most urban areas of Vietnam. Many aspects of the presen-tation could be compatible with leptospirosis, but the absence of suspected rodent exposure makes this less likely. # Page 2 Another differential diagnosis to consider in a diabetic from South East Asia with possible sepsis is melioidosis. What are the priorities for management? With a diagnosis of severe dengue highly likely, supportive management of the patient’s cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be prioritized."

        "Enteric fever, an important disease in low-income tropical countries, can cause confusion and should be considered, but the rate of disease progression in this case is uncharacteristic. Dengue fever is endemic in South-east Asia and should also be con-sidered. Skin changes in dengue usually present with tran-sient flushing erythema of the face followed by a diffuse erythematous, blanching rash on days 3 to 6. A small propor-tion of patients develop severe disease during a second, immune-mediated phase (usually on day 4-6). This phase may be complicated by capillary leak, shock, mucocutaneous bleeding and organ involvement. Dengue may also present as encephalitis. In this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningi-tis and shock is not typical for dengue. Melioidosis is another differential diagnosis to consider. In some areas of South-east Asia, it is the commonest cause of community-acquired sepsis, and diabetes is known to be a risk factor for the disease. Melioidosis may also cause brain abscess and encephalitis. However, melioidosis is compara-tively rare in Vietnam, where the true burden of disease remains to be elucidated.

        "Given the clinical syndrome of fever, retro-orbital pain, arthralgias and thrombocytopenia after a visit to Thailand, the most likely differential diagnosis to suspect is dengue fever. Dengue is the most common febrile tropical disease seen in returning travellers from South and South-east Asia. The duration of fever, however, is borderline long for den-gue. The dengue NS1 antigen test reflecting dengue viraemia may already be negative at day 6 and does not reliably rule out the infection. Chikungunya and Zika are additional important arboviral infections to suspect. Influenza is another important differential diagnosis to have in this patient. Fever and associated symptoms are usu-ally of shorter duration but may last as long as 8 days. Acute HIV infection may present with persistent fever and throm-bocytopenia, and possible exposures should definitely be inquired. Enteric fever presents with persistent febrile tem-peratures and otherwise non-specific symptoms. Because food hygiene in Thailand is overall very good, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are nowadays rarely seen imported from 256 # Page 2 this country. Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile trav-eller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocyto-penia also being a hallmark feature.

        "A history of fever is usual in non-immune patients, but other features of the presentation are non-specific and overlap with many other infections, with headache and malaise. Malaria should always be high on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics, because there are many misleading presentations. The only way to exclude malaria is a malaria blood test. Diagnosed early before complications begin, falciparum malaria is relatively easily treated with antimalarial drug combinations. In patients with severe malaria, artesunate is the drug of choice; if this is not available locally, artemether or quinine are the alternatives. In adults, cerebral malaria (for practical purposes altered consciousness, seizures), acute renal failure and pulmonary oedema or ARDS are the most common manifestations of severity, and may occur together or in any combination. Renal failure, and in particular ARDS, often presents later in treatment, and may first become apparent after all parasites have cleared. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock (often with co-existing bacteraemia) are rare complications. Elderly patients have a high mortality. Various adjunctive treatments for malaria complications have been tried but to date none shows survival advantage. The key to malaria management is to diagnose it early and get effective antimalarial drugs into the patient as soon as possible."

It is causally associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and malaria, and has a chromosomal translocation that activates the c-myc oncogene.

Because Lassa fever is common, it should be considered in anyone with an unexplained febrile condition who has visited an endemic area within the past 21 days and appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented. It is more common in people from rural than urban areas, but it does occur in towns. Treatment with IV ribavirin is likely to be beneficial if given early in the disease, but it should also be considered in patients who are diagnosed late.

        "In any febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region, malaria has to be ruled out, even if other diagnoses seem obvious. The diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is primarily clinical. 149 # Page 2 from the eschar scab may confirm the diagnosis. For confirmative serology, paired samples would have to be taken and may be more of academic value in this case. Afri-can tick-bite fever is usually a mild, self-limiting disease. Doxycycline can be given to speed up recovery. The Case Continued… The malaria rapid diagnostic test, as well as thick and thin film for malaria, came back negative. The patient was pre-scribed doxycycline at 100mg bid for 1 week. The fever settled within the next few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after about 2 weeks. SUMMARY BOX African Tick-Bite Fever African tick-bite fever (ATBF) is the second most common specific cause of fever after malaria in travellers returning from sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the spotted fever group of rickettsioses, a large group of infections, which are mainly transmitted by ticks. An overview of rickettsial infections and their vectors is given in Table 54.1. ATBF is caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by cattle ticks of the genus Amblyomma, which act both as reservoir and as vector. Other reservoir hosts are wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, buffalos, rhinos, and hippos."

Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arbo-viral infection, which is also in line with the putative incu-bation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chi-kungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much 214 # Page 2 of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduc-tion, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years. Acute dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections have similar presentations and may be clinically indistinguishable. However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1).",

However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1). Answer to Question 2 What Diagnostic Tests Would You Perform? When testing for arboviral infections, the kinetics of the dif-ferent test parameters have to be taken into account. During the early phase of infection, viral and viral antigen (e.g. dengue specific NS1) are circulating in the blood and can be detected by and specific antigen assays, respec-tively. After some days, viraemia is fading, terminated by the host’s immune response, and viral RNA and antigen become undetectable in the blood samples, while now spe-cific IgM and IgG rise and become detectable (Fig. 77.2). The diagnosis is made by the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen or specific IgM, or by the documentation of a four-fold rise of specific IgG antibody titres in paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples. In resource-poor countries, as well as in daily clinical practice in travel medicine, rapid diag-nostic tests (RDTs) for dengue (testing for NS1-Ag, IgM, and IgG) and chikungunya (testing for IgM) are widely available and often the primarily performed diagnostic tests.",
        "Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’ duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery. Dengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these methods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral blood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed, (at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however, cross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, espe-cially in Zika endemic areas. Warning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increas-ing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytope-nia, six of which were present in this case. With no antiviral treatment available, cautious intravascular volume replacement and supportive treatment are the mainstays of management, accompanied by careful monitoring for signs of fluid overload. In many countries the epidemiology of dengue is changing in line with aging populations.",
        "He remains tachycardic and oliguric with a haematocrit rise to 55.1%, therefore the rate of fluid therapy is increased to 15mL/kg/hr until sufficient haemodynamic improvement is shown. The rate of fluid delivery is subsequently reduced to 7mL/kg/hr for 2 hours and by a further 2mL/kg/hr every 2 hours until no longer required. Repeat clinical assessments are undertaken at two-hourly intervals throughout, with hae-matocrit checks every 6 hours. The patient is discharged from hospital 3 days later, after complete recovery. Reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and a positive NS1 ELISA confirm dengue diagnosis. SUMMARY BOX Dengue Dengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect humans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million infections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus family and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosqui-toes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive temperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in Europe and North America. Although most clinically apparent infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority progress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding, capillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’ duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery."

        "In the majority of cases the complaints are self-limiting and subside under symptomatic treatment with non-steroidal drugs over weeks to months. Viral arthritis: Although self-limiting polyarthralgias are present during the acute phase of many viral infections, prolonged polyar-thritis/polyarthralgias are characteristic for certain viral infec-tions. Worldwide, parvovirus B19, hepatitis and C, HIV, rubella and the alphaviruses are the most common infections to consider in the differential diagnosis. Although rubella has become rare because of vaccination, the vector-borne, alphaviral infections are becoming increasingly rele-vant in endemic regions and in returning travellers (see Table 87.1). Unlike reactive arthritis, viral arthritis primarily presents as symmetrical polyarthritis of peripheral small joints. CHAPTER 87 A 27-Year-Old Male Traveller Returning from the Peruvian Amazon With Persisting Polyarthralgias # Page 3 Answer to Question 2 What Diagnostic Test Would You Perform? The diagnostic principles for most alphaviruses are the same: During the first days of the acute infection, detection of viral RNA in the blood by PCR may confirm the diagnosis. Beyond the acute phase, the diagnosis is based upon serolog-ical detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the respective virus. Cross-reactivity within the same virus family is common. Reference laboratories therefore usually perform parallel testing for potentially cross-reacting viruses (see Table 87.2) and apply a two-step approach, using highly sen-sitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirma-tory assays.",
        "Infection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific febrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history of diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild splenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients, hepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with iNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection, with pathogens such as M. tuberculosis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection. Blood culture remains the diagnostic standard; however, it is not widely available in many African settings. Also, sensitivity of blood culture is suboptimal because of the low magnitude of bacteraemia (median <1 CFU/mL). Care should therefore be taken to inoculate large enough volumes of blood for culture. Antimicrobial resistance among iNTS strains in Africa is increasing. Empirical management is similar to enteric fever and includes either a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, depending on the local resistance pattern and drug availability. If oral intake is not possible, a third-generation cephalosporin should be administered. Effective antibiotic treatment should be given for 10 to 14 days. Antiretroviral therapy should be started urgently to prevent relapse. The case fatality rate of patients with iNTS is much higher than in enteric fever (22-47% vs 1%).",

During the early phase of infection, viral and viral antigen (e.g. dengue specific NS1) are circulating in the blood and can be detected by and specific antigen assays, respec-tively. After some days, viraemia is fading, terminated by the host’s immune response, and viral RNA and antigen become undetectable in the blood samples, while now spe-cific IgM and IgG rise and become detectable (Fig. 77.2). The diagnosis is made by the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen or specific IgM, or by the documentation of a four-fold rise of specific IgG antibody titres in paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples.

        "SUMMARY BOX Acute Arboviral Infection Acute dengue, chikungunya, and Zika infections have similar presentations and are often clinically indistinguishable. Although the pattern of clinical symptoms can point towards the correct diagnosis, specific molecular or immunological tests are nec-essary to make a final diagnosis. Interpretation of serological test results demands some caution, because cross-reactivity of antibodies directed against viruses belonging to the same family of viruses may be misleading. Although dengue virus NS1 antigen tests are mostly specific for dengue virus infection, serological assays may show cross-reactivity with Zika virus (ZIKV) specific antibodies (as in our case). The diagnostic value of RT-PCR for detection of Zika virus RNA in the blood is limited because viraemia is usually low and limited to the first few days after disease onset. However, Zika virus RNA detection in urine provides a feasible alternative: ZIKV is detectable with higher RNA loads and for a longer period (10-20 days after onset of symptoms) in urine samples than in serum samples. Arboviral infections are self-limiting and, in the absence of specific treatment options, clinical management is exclusively supportive. Special features of Zika virus include its sexual transmissibility, the potential to trigger post-infectious Guillan-Barr e-Syndrome, and, in the case of intrauterine infection, its ability to cause severe foetopathy (primarily microcephaly).",

The Case continued… Because the performed RDTs for dengue and chikungunya both showed a negative result, the patient’s blood samples were sent to a reference laboratory for arboviruses and our clinical suspicion of a Zika virus infection was confirmed by PCR as well as seroconversion (Table 77.2).

        "Adult L. loa migrate through the subcutaneous and connective tissues of the human body. Migration may cause urticaria and transient painless subcutane-ous swellings (‘Calabar swellings’), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, which is noticed by the patient as intense itching of the eye, pain and photophobia. Passage of the palpebral conjunctiva is associated with swelling of the eyelid and the periorbital region. Loiasis may cause renal complications (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) and a wide range of neurological symptoms. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae that are detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime with a peak around noon, but are usually absent at night. This diurnal periodicity corresponds to the day-biting habits of the Chrysops vectors. Microfilaraemia in L. loa infection tends to be higher than in lymphatic filariasis, where microfilariaemia is usually betweeen 1 and 1000 mf/ml. However, there is also a high percentage of amicrofilaraemic individuals (‘occult loiasis’) in endemic areas, which poses a diagnostic challenge.

There is a localized swelling with a central scab. This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely.

        "The skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but may occur in any part of the body that came into contact with infested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent affected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms may invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia. Diagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history. Skin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in advance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests available, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases. The treatment of choice is ivermectin (200μg/kg for 1-2 days.). Albendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-cated or not available. Albendazole 400mg should be given twice daily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10-15% tds for 5 to 10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be difficult in multiple lesions. Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor. For prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should be dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In resource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual protection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair on the beach because towels may be covered with sand and therefore do not protect sufficiently.",
        "Not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium leprae can cause ulcerating skin lesions. mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that may cause a highly fatal disease. It usually starts as a painless plaque, often after local trauma. Balamuthia lesions are characterized by reddish or purplish infiltrations; ulceration is uncommon. The most frequent location of the initial lesion is the central face, over the nose. In a few months, it can progress to the brain causing granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. If this occurs, the survival time is usually less than 8 weeks. The most likely diagnosis in our case is cutaneous leish-maniasis, because of the frequency of leishmaniasis in the val-ley our patient had travelled to and the characteristic presentation (localized painless ulcer with raised edges). Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach This Patient? Gently clean the lesion with water, remove the scab and take a closer look at the process underneath. definitive diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis requires the demonstration of the parasite through microscopic examination, culture or molec-ular techniques. The simplest approach is to scrape with a lancet under the edges of the lesion, and use the obtained material for a smear examination with Giemsa staining, looking for Leishmania amastigotes. The sensitivity of this technique is about 70%, decreasing as the duration of the lesion increases.",
        "In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango fly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy ground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on a clothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents. Humans become infected when lying on the ground or wearing contami-nated clothes without prior hot ironing. Larvae hatch and burrow into the skin. Over the following 2 to 3 weeks the developing larvae cause an itchy and at times painful ‘blind boil.’ Lesions are usually sterile because of bacteriostatic substances produced in the larvae’s guts. Treatment aims to deprive the larvae of oxygen, which prompts them to extrude from the skin. This can be achieved by applying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin on the lesion to block their respiratory spiracles. Immature larvae are best left to develop for a while because they are difficult to retrieve, and maceration of the larva can lead to inflammation and superinfection. Even untreated, cutaneous myiasis is self-limiting because the mature larva has to leave the host and pupate elsewhere. In Central and South America, myiasis is caused by Derma-tobia hominis, the human botfly (Fig. 8.2). Unlike the Tumbu fly, this species lays its eggs directly on exposed skin. Furthermore, it deposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, flies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a technique called ‘hitch-hiking.’ Removal of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision.",

Infectious diseases that can cause similar lesions in the face are cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuber-culosis and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris, a free-living amoeba. Although common bacterial infections of the skin that are partially treated or masked as a consequence of traditional remedies (e.g. chemical burns) are another possibility; this is less likely in our case given the chronic nature of the lesion. Cutaneous anthrax and tularaemia could be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions located on the extremities, but the latter is endemic in the Northern hemisphere only, and the long duration without any further symptoms does not fit with either infection. In addtion, cutaneous anthrax tends to present with considerable localized oedema not seen in this case. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a common, vector-borne, parasitic disease that affects people living in or travelling to endemic areas.

        "It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SJS, less than 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30% is affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Between 10% and 30% it is classified as ‘SJS/TEN overlap’. The extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for prognosis. In Western industrialized countries, SJS/TEN is considered rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year. However, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive individuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and other high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this condition. The drugs most commonly implicated in SJS/TEN are antibiotics (in particular sulfonamides, but also other classes), the antiretroviral nevirapine, anticonvulsants and allopurinol. Infectious agents (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and HSV) may also be responsible. Host genetic factors also seem to play a role. The pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of an unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis. SJS/TEN often starts with non-specific, flu-like symptoms. After several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more and more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to flaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis (Fig.",
        "# Page 18614-Year-Old Girl in the Solomon Islands With a Non-Healing Leg Ulcer MITIÀ Clinical Presentation History 14-year-old girl was seen in the Solomon Islands. She reported a painless, non-healing large ulcer of her left leg that began 1 month earlier. Clinical Findings On examination there was a large lesion (approximately 3 cm diameter) on the left lower leg covered by a layer of crust (Fig. 86.1). Lower down the leg a smaller, similar lesion was noted. There was no regional lymphadenopathy or evi-dence of any other skin or bone lesions. Laboratory results rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at a titre of 1:64 (Normal-Negative). Questions 1. What is the most likely diagnosis when the patient first presents and how should she be treated? 2. How would you manage her? How should she be followed up? Discussion 14-year-old girl from the Solomon Islands presenting with a chronic leg ulcer. Answer to Question 1 What is the Most Likely Diagnosis When the Patient First Presents and How Should She Be Treated? The patient has a clinical lesion suspicious for yaws, which is still a common problem in the West Pacific. The satellite lesion on the leg is also very typical of early yaws lesions. The patient has a high-titre positive test which is con-sistent with the diagnosis. A number of other bacteria, in par-ticular Haemophilus ducreyi, can cause skin lesions that clinically appear similar to those of early yaws."

What is the most likely diagnosis and what is the differ-ential diagnosis? 2. What is the appropriate clinical approach in the given context? Discussion A 7-year-old West African girl presents with two progressive cutaneous ulcers linked by an area of altered skin. The move-ment in the associated joint is restricted. General symptoms are limited to a mildly elevated temperature. Answer to Question 1 What is the Most Likely Diagnosis and What is the Differential Diagnosis? The geographical region of West Africa, the young age of the patient, the location of the lesion on the extremities, the absence of major trauma and the clinical picture lead to a sus-pected diagnosis diagnosis of Buruli ulcer (BU). The history of an insect bite is an incidental finding, the mode of trans-mission of the causative organism, Mycobacterium ulcerans, remains unknown. Pain and low-grade fever as seen in this case may also be explained by bacterial superinfection. A careful history and physical examination will provide guidance in differentiating numerous other infectious (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) and non-infectious (trauma, envenoming, autoimmune, haematological, neoplastic) causes of ulcers in tropical coun-tries.",
        "It can also occur in malnutrition, Down’s syndrome and in the elderly and institutionalized, especially those with physical or cognitive disability who are unable to scratch. Patients with crusted scabies can have many thousands of mites in skin lesions and can serve as ‘core transmitters’ for continuing outbreaks of scabies in communities and nursing homes. Mites from crusted scabies cases are not genetically distinct, with ordinary scabies occurring in those infected from these cases. Crusted scabies results from unfettered mite reproduction and host reaction, resulting in formation of hyperkeratotic skin crusts that may be loose and flaky or thick and adherent. Skin flakes with thousands of mites can be shed onto bed linen and floors. Although hands and feet are most commonly involved, the distribution is often extensive, including neck, face and scalp as well as axillae, trunk, buttocks and limbs, especially knees and elbows. Thick deposits of debris with mites accumulate beneath the nails, which are often thickened and dystrophic. Crusting can be limited to one or two limbs, hands or fingers. Unlike ordinary scabies, where itching is usually intense, the presence of itch is variable in crusted scabies. Fissuring and secondary bacterial infection are common (Fig. 10.2). A peripheral blood eosinophilia is common but not always present, and serum IgE levels are often extremely high. There is high mortality in crusted scabies cases from secondary bacterial sepsis, including with Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to S.",
        "The ulcer is painless unless there is bacterial superinfection. Patients may have several lesions. Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimor-phic fungus that is found in soil and on plants. It enters the skin through direct inoculation (e.g. thorny plants or animal scratch). The disease usually starts with a papule that turns into a tender ulcer. Lesions can spread along draining lym-phatic vessels. Sporotrichosis occurs throughout the world as a sporadic disease of farmers and gardeners. This disease is hyperendemic in parts of the Peruvian Andes, where it often affects children and typically produces facial lesions. 4 # Page 2 However, our patient did not travel to such a hyper-endemic place. Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon manifestation of tuberculosis. It occurs by direct inoculation of mycobacteria into the skin of non-sensitized individuals (e.g. children) or as a result of reactivation in persons with previous immunity against mycobacteria. As our patient lives in a poor neighbour-hood with a high incidence of tuberculosis, we cannot rule out this diagnosis.

        "Not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium leprae can cause ulcerating skin lesions. mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that may cause a highly fatal disease. It usually starts as a painless plaque, often after local trauma. Balamuthia lesions are characterized by reddish or purplish infiltrations; ulceration is uncommon. The most frequent location of the initial lesion is the central face, over the nose. In a few months, it can progress to the brain causing granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. If this occurs, the survival time is usually less than 8 weeks. The most likely diagnosis in our case is cutaneous leish-maniasis, because of the frequency of leishmaniasis in the val-ley our patient had travelled to and the characteristic presentation (localized painless ulcer with raised edges). Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach This Patient? Gently clean the lesion with water, remove the scab and take a closer look at the process underneath. definitive diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis requires the demonstration of the parasite through microscopic examination, culture or molec-ular techniques. The simplest approach is to scrape with a lancet under the edges of the lesion, and use the obtained material for a smear examination with Giemsa staining, looking for Leishmania amastigotes. The sensitivity of this technique is about 70%, decreasing as the duration of the lesion increases.",
        "SUMMARY BOX Leg Ulcers in Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of autosomal-codominant genetic disorders characterized by the production of abnormal sickle haemoglobin S (HbS). Homozygous HbSS leads to sickle cell anaemia, the most severe form of SCD. Sickle cell disease is the commonest hereditary haematological disorder. HbS has the tendency to polymerize during hypoxia. This leads to a reduction of the flexibility of the erythrocyte and to the typical sickle shape of the affected cell. Sickled red blood cells lead to haemolysis and vaso-occlusion. The disease is characterized by episodes of acute illness against a background of progressive organ damage. Any organ can be affected by SCD at any age; however, certain features tend to predominate in certain age-groups. Leg ulcers tend to manifest in adulthood. Pathophysiology is complex and remains incompletely understood. Ulcers in SCD occur in areas with thin skin and little subcutaneous fat, most commonly on the ankles. They are notoriously difficult to treat. The ulcers are slow to heal and are characterized by unexplained relapses. They are com-monly very painful and patients may occasionally require opioids for pain control. Colonization with pathogenic bacteria is com-mon. Periosteal reaction is usually seen in the underlying bones but osteomyelitis is uncommon."

In a resource-constrained place like South Sudan, a prag-matic clinical approach is necessary. The history should be taken as accurately as possible to narrow down the differen-tial diagnosis. One should try to find out if the patient comes from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic. For possible HIV infection, it would be of great importance to find out if the parents and siblings are alive and well; and enquiries should be made if there are any close contacts who are suspected to have TB or who have a history of recent TB treatment.

He had been in Mozambique from 16 April to 30 April, and travelled to Chile afterwards from 30 April to 17 May. He did not take any malaria chemopro-phylaxis in Mozambique and reports self-treatment for malaria with atovaquone/proguanil because of fever (27 April to 29 April). He is now complaining of recurrent fever for the past 3 days. The day before presentation his temperature was as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F). He also has some headache and diarrhoea. He reports freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo. His past medical history is unremarkable. Clinical Findings 43-year-old male, febrile, with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). The rest of the physical examination is normal and there is no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly and no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory Results The relevant laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 20.1. Further Investigations Electrocardiogram is normal.

        "Rates of ALA are 3 to 20 times higher in men between 18 and 50 years of age than in other populations; the reasons for this are poorly understood but hormonal factors are being discussed, as well as alcohol consumption. Humans acquire the infection by ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water. Trophozoites of E. histolytica may penetrate the intestinal wall and haematogenously spread to the liver. Clinical manifestations include fever with chills, right hypochondrial pain, anorexia and weight loss, but most patients with ALA do not have a history of recent dysentery. A dry cough and fine crepitations over the right lung bases are common. Jaundice is unusual. Localized intercostal tenderness helps in the clinical diagnosis. ALA may rupture into the peritoneal cavity or through the skin or diaphragm. Haematogenous spread may cause metastatic abscesses in distant organs such as the brain. Leukocytosis, raised inflammatory parameters and an ele-vated alkaline phosphatase are the most common non-specific laboratory findings. Diagnosis is usually made by a combination of imaging studies and serology. Abdominal ultrasound scan is the most suitable imaging technique in resource-limited settings, but CT and MRI scans are also highly sensitive. None of the imaging techniques is specific for ALA. Plain radiography of the thorax may reveal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Serology is highly sensitive but may lack specificity in indi-viduals from endemic countries.",

        "When eggs reach fresh water, miracidia hatch and infect a snail (first intermediate host). After asexual multiplication, cercariae are released and infect a crab or crayfish (second intermediate host). Human infection occurs mainly via consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish contaminated with Paragonimus metacercariae. In addition, eating raw meat of wild boar, which is a paratenic host, is an important route of infection, especially in Japan. Venison (deer meet) has also been proven as the potential source of P. westermani infection in humans. Because the range of paratenic hosts may even be wider, eating wild animal meat in general may be a risk factor for this disease. Metacercariae excyst in the small intestine and penetrate the intestinal wall. They pass through the liver and diaphragm, invade the pleural space and finally enter the lung parenchyma where they mature into adults and produce eggs. Juvenile worms sometimes migrate into subcutaneous soft tissue or the central nervous system to cause unexpected, potentially deleterious lesions. Clinical features of the disease are similar to those of pulmo-nary TB or lung cancer. Patients may have chronic cough, hae-moptysis, chest pain, fever, night sweats and abnormal findings on chest imaging. Pleural effusion (Fig. 71.2) with marked eosinophilia in the exudate and pneumothorax without apparent nodular lesion/cavitation may occur in the early stages and/or in light infections.",

In β-thalassaemia the so-called Mentzer index (MCV [fL] : Erythrocyte count [ 1012/L]) is typically below 13; in iron deficiency it is above 13. Intestinal helminth infection can contribute to anaemia. Because reliable stool microscopy may not be feasible in a resource-constrained setting, pragmatic anthelmintic treat-ment appears justifiable. Vitamin B3 (niacin) should be sup-plemented and it should be evaluated how the family’s diet could be improved despite their poor socioeconomic circum-stances. A simple affordable trick is to advise the patient to eat some of the maize directly from the cob, because it is the husks that harbour tryptophan and that go lost during preparation of white maize flour. It is a slight irony in this case that the husband is working on a local chicken farm and still cannot afford a balanced diet that includes eggs and poultry for his family.

A number of other people who attended the same festival have also fallen ill with diarrhoea. Answer to Question 1 How Was the Infection Most Likely Acquired? Is There an Outbreak? Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environ-mental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums where basic infrastructure is not available and rural and urban areas in endemic countries where sanitation is limited, including refugee camps. Additionally, natural disasters, as well as times of political and social unrest associated with a collapse of infrastructure, pose a risk of cholera.",
        "SUMMARY BOX Giardiasis Giardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis (also called G. lamblia), a flagellate protozoan. The parasite is present throughout the world, with several species found in animals. Not all infections result in symptoms, particularly in tropical countries where local populations with constant exposure rarely develop disease. Symptomatic giardiasis is common in travellers to regions of South and South-east Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, particularly where clean water supplies and standards of food hygiene are low. Giardia trophozoites are found in the small intestine of humans, and these non-invasive parasites appear to cause diarrhoea by blocking the absorptive surfaces of the gut and possibly by inducing fluid secretion. The trophozoites produce an environmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool and enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel movements. The most common method of infection is by drinking contaminated water. However, people may also become infected through hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating contaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and unknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of giardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symp-toms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps, gas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The symptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer. Giardiasis can cause malabsorption of vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron, fat and carbohydrates in up to 20-40% of patients.",

        "cholerae and asymptomatic carriage is possible. The main source of trans-mission is from a contaminated water source. In some parts of the world, copepods are responsible for maintaining Vibrio spp. in a viable but non-cultivable state. The incubation period ranges between 12 hours and 5 days. Patients are usually afebrile and do not have any abdominal pain. The major clinical challenge is dehydration, ranging from mild to severe, and electrolyte imbalance leading on to renal failure in severe cases. In epidemics, the diagnosis of cholera may be presumptive on clinical and epidemiological grounds following the WHO clinical case definition. Laboratory confirmation may be required when sporadic cases occur or when an extensive outbreak requires confirmation and typing of the etiological agent. Treatment typically involves isolation of the patient, correction of dehydration and antimicrobial treatment. In most cases oral replacement solutions may be used. Antimicrobial therapy is secondary; it is shown to decrease shedding of the bacteria and also hastens clinical resolution of illness. Tetracycline and doxy-cycline are the preferred drugs in adults, but ciprofloxacin or macrolides can also be used depending on availability and local resistance pattern. Public health measures to improve water and sanitation are essential for long-term control. WHO has endorsed the inclusion of oral vaccines in cholera control programmes in endemic areas in conjunction with other preventive and control strategies."

Schistosoma haematobium eggs had been identified in his urine and he had been treated with a full dose of praziquantel, a course of ciprofloxacin, busco-pan and bisacodyl. He had swum regularly in Lake Malawi. An abdominal ultrasound scan after attempted micturi-tion showed a large bladder residue without further abnormalities. Full blood count showed a normal absolute WBC of 9109/L with a relative eosinophilia of 21.8% (reference range: 1-6%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 1.15109/L (reference: <0.45109/L). ALT was slightly elevated. Creatinine and CRP were normal. An HIV test and the VDRL were negative and micros-copy of a stool and urine sample were normal. Serological tests for schistosomiasis were not available. An MRI scan of the spinal cord was performed (Fig. 63.1). An enhancing 1cm large lesion was seen at the anterior aspect of the conus, with associated high T2 sig-nal representing oedema extending from the lower end of the conus to the level of T9. In addition, there was nodular thickening of the urine bladder wall at the base and the pos-terior aspect. The diagnosis of an infection with Schistosoma haemato-bium was made as evidenced by the urine findings and sup-ported by the eosinophilia and the abnormalities seen in the bladder wall on MRI scanning.",
        "In renal com-promise secondary to hypertension, one would expect the kidneys to be small. Being a fisherman, the patient has been in regular contact with Schistosoma haematobium-infested water in Lake Malawi. Chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis is one of the top differential diagnoses to suspect. Answer to Question 2 What Further Investigations Would You Like to Perform to Establish the Diagnosis? The most useful investigation at this point is an ultrasound of the kidneys to differentiate between, primary renal patholog-ical condition and a post-renal problem. If there was hydro-nephrosis, obstruction at the level of the bladder seems most likely because both kidneys appear enlarged. On cystoscopy, endoscopists can macroscopically estab-lish the diagnosis, but ideally, biopsies should be performed to look for evidence of granulomatous inflammation and S. haematobium ova in the tissue and to rule out neoplasia. In chronic infection, urine microscopy may be negative for ova of S. haematobium. The Case Continued. . . Despite high doses of furosemide, the patient remained oliguric. Glucose and insulin were administered for his hyperkalaemia. Ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis with massive dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces. The remaining renal parenchyma was very thin in both kidneys. Cystoscopy revealed a hyperaemic mucosa with multiple ‘sandy patches’ suggestive of granulomatous lesions in the mucosa.",
        "SUMMARY BOX Genitourinary Schistosomiasis Genitourinary schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium is endemic in large parts of Africa and in the Middle East. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common tropical diseases in migrants from endemic countries and should actively be screened for. About 50% of Schistosoma eggs are shed through urine, the other half remain trapped in the tissue causing granulomatous inflammation. Around 10% of people infected progress to chronic late-stage disease. Risk factors for disease progression are poorly understood and include intensity and duration of infection, host genetic factors and parasite strain differences. Chronic infection leads to granulomatous inflammation of bladder wall and ureteral mucosa resulting in obstructive uropathy, hydronephrosis, recurrent bacterial pyelonephritis and end-stage renal disease. It is also suspected to contribute to the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. The pathological changes can long go unnoticed. Egg deposition in the female genital tract may result in dyspareunia, chronic lower abdominal pain, ectopic pregnancy and infertility and has also been associated with an increased risk of HIV infection. Men may present with scrotal swelling, orchitis and prostatitis, haematospermia and oligospermia. The white arrows show ‘sandy patches’ (left) and hyperaemia of the bladder mucosa (top).

Biopsy is often unavailable and serology is unhelpful in an endemic setting, because it can only detect exposure without indicating the activity, duration or quantum of infection. A promising point-of-care diagnostic tool may be circulating anodic antigen (CAA), which is under development. The investigation of choice is ultrasound. Hydronephrosis and bladder wall abnormalities can easily be demonstrated. On cystoscopy a hyperaemic mucosa with ‘sandy patches’ may be seen (Fig. 7.2). Sandy patches are raised, yellowish mucosal irregularities associated with heavy egg deposition surrounded by fibrous tissue pathognomonic for schistosomiasis. Praziquantel may reverse the early stages of infection but has little role to play in advanced hydronephrosis. It may still be given to kill remaining adult flukes. Otherwise, late-stage urogenital schistosomiasis has to be managed symptomatically, which can be challenging in settings where renal replacement therapy is not an option.",
        "The skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but may occur in any part of the body that came into contact with infested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent affected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms may invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia. Diagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history. Skin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in advance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests available, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases. The treatment of choice is ivermectin (200μg/kg for 1-2 days.). Albendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-cated or not available. Albendazole 400mg should be given twice daily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10-15% tds for 5 to 10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be difficult in multiple lesions. Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor. For prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should be dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In resource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual protection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair on the beach because towels may be covered with sand and therefore do not protect sufficiently."

        "Discussion Six days after returning from a 2-week holiday to Guate-mala and El Salvador, a 51-year-old female Swiss traveller presents with a slightly pruritic disseminated maculo-papular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees and feet) and a generalized lym-phadenopathy. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arbo-viral infection, which is also in line with the putative incu-bation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chi-kungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much 214 # Page 2 of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduc-tion, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years. Acute dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections have similar presentations and may be clinically indistinguishable. However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1).",

Ten years prior, he had a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week later a small painless red nodule devel-oped at the site of the bite. Over the following years the lesion slowly increased in size; further lesions developed and spread up to his knee. Three days before admission his ankle became painful and swollen. Clinical Findings Vital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile. His left lower leg and foot are grossly swollen (Fig. 25.1); the skin is hyperaemic and feels hot. There are several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on his left lower leg and foot. The lesions are partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour.

        "Adult L. loa migrate through the subcutaneous and connective tissues of the human body. Migration may cause urticaria and transient painless subcutane-ous swellings (‘Calabar swellings’), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, which is noticed by the patient as intense itching of the eye, pain and photophobia. Passage of the palpebral conjunctiva is associated with swelling of the eyelid and the periorbital region. Loiasis may cause renal complications (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) and a wide range of neurological symptoms. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae that are detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime with a peak around noon, but are usually absent at night. This diurnal periodicity corresponds to the day-biting habits of the Chrysops vectors. Microfilaraemia in L. loa infection tends to be higher than in lymphatic filariasis, where microfilariaemia is usually betweeen 1 and 1000 mf/ml. However, there is also a high percentage of amicrofilaraemic individuals (‘occult loiasis’) in endemic areas, which poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis in loiasis relies on the typical passage of the adults through the bulbar conjunctiva (‘eye worm’).",
        "Rates of ALA are 3 to 20 times higher in men between 18 and 50 years of age than in other populations; the reasons for this are poorly understood but hormonal factors are being discussed, as well as alcohol consumption. Humans acquire the infection by ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water. Trophozoites of E. histolytica may penetrate the intestinal wall and haematogenously spread to the liver. Clinical manifestations include fever with chills, right hypochondrial pain, anorexia and weight loss, but most patients with ALA do not have a history of recent dysentery. A dry cough and fine crepitations over the right lung bases are common. Jaundice is unusual. Localized intercostal tenderness helps in the clinical diagnosis. ALA may rupture into the peritoneal cavity or through the skin or diaphragm. Haematogenous spread may cause metastatic abscesses in distant organs such as the brain. Leukocytosis, raised inflammatory parameters and an ele-vated alkaline phosphatase are the most common non-specific laboratory findings. Diagnosis is usually made by a combination of imaging studies and serology. Abdominal ultrasound scan is the most suitable imaging technique in resource-limited settings, but CT and MRI scans are also highly sensitive. None of the imaging techniques is specific for ALA. Plain radiography of the thorax may reveal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Serology is highly sensitive but may lack specificity in indi-viduals from endemic countries."

        "They shed microfilariae which are ingested by female mosquitoes during blood-meals. The most common features of bancroftian filariasis are hydrocoele, acute adenolymphangitis (ADLA) and lymphoedema. Hydrocoele results from the accumulation of fluid in the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testes. Most cases are unilateral. In endemic areas, hydrocoeles start to develop in early adulthood. Prevalence rates rise steadily with age. Rupture of dilated abdominal lymphatic vessels into the urinary tract may lead to chyluria. Brugian filariasis is milder than infection with W. bancrofti, and urogenital complica-tions do not occur. Acute ADLA occurs in episodic events that start with fever, chills and severe malaise. Regional lymph nodes are tender and enlarged, the affected limb may become swollen and hot and the skin may peel off. Repeated episodes of ADLA can lead to lymphoedema. Chronic lymphoedema most commonly affects the lower leg, but may also involve the arms, breasts and genitals, as shown in this case. The most advanced stage of chronic lymphoedema (stage III) is also referred to as ‘elephantiasis’. Chronic ulceration with bacterial and fungal superinfection is a common problem. Moreover, in areas of high HIV prevalence, lymphatic filari-asis was found to increase susceptibility to HIV infection by inducing systemic CD4 T-cell activation.",

        "The most common differentials to consider in a chronic, non-tender, unilateral scrotal swelling are inguinal hernia and hydrocoele. testicular tumour also needs to be taken into consideration. Unlike hydrocoeles, hernias can often be manually reduced. Hydrocoeles may be verified by trans-illumination with a penlight. The patient reports that scrotal swelling is common in the region where he comes from. This may suggest a possible infectious aetiology. The most important infectious disease to consider in this patient is lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. Hydrocoele is the most common clinical abnormality in men with bancroftian filariasis. Also, urogenital schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haemato-bium) may lead to unilateral scrotal swelling, but it is not endemic in South-east Asia. Testicular tuberculosis is another infectious disease that may manifest with scrotal swelling. However, the long duration of the swelling in the absence of other signs and symptoms make this unlikely, and it would not explain the large number of cases seen in his home region. Answer Question 2 What Investigations Would You Like to Do? Ultrasound can help distinguish a testicular tumour from a hydrocoele or hernia. Also, in case of lymphatic filariasis, adult worms may be seen on scrotal ultrasonography (“filarial dance sign”). The swelling is non-tender and non-reducible.",
        "Answer to Question 1 What Are the Most Important Differential Diagnoses? The three major causes of genital ulceration are Herpes sim-plex, syphilis and chancroid. Ulcers caused by simplex are self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, and do not usually last longer than a few days. They can be severe and persistent in the immunocompromised. Ulcers caused by primary syphilis are usually painless, and it is unusual for there to be more than a single ulcer. Inguinal adenopathy is sometimes seen but is usually painless. Ulcers caused by chancroid are often multiple, and usually painful. In some 50% of cases painful inguinal lymphadenopathy is found. Inguinal buboes may be fluctuant and sometimes rupture, releasing large amounts of pus. However, the clinical diagnosis of genital ulcer disease is unreliable. For this reason, the patient should be treated syn-dromically for both syphilis and chancroid. If he is HIV-positive, additional treatment for herpes should also be considered. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage This Patient? Treat him for syphilis with a single dose of benzathine pen-icillin 2.4 million units. Treat him for chancroid with a single dose of azithromycin 1g PO or ciprofloxacin 500mg bid for 3 days or erythromycin 500mg qds for 7 days.",
        "It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SJS, less than 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30% is affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Between 10% and 30% it is classified as ‘SJS/TEN overlap’. The extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for prognosis. In Western industrialized countries, SJS/TEN is considered rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year. However, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive individuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and other high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this condition. The drugs most commonly implicated in SJS/TEN are antibiotics (in particular sulfonamides, but also other classes), the antiretroviral nevirapine, anticonvulsants and allopurinol. Infectious agents (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and HSV) may also be responsible. Host genetic factors also seem to play a role. The pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of an unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis. SJS/TEN often starts with non-specific, flu-like symptoms. After several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more and more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to flaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis (Fig.",

        "Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses and Which Investigations Would You Like to Do? The patient has travelled in Mozambique without taking any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Thus first of all malaria has to be excluded-irrespective of any other symptoms or lab-oratory results. The differential diagnosis of pyrexia in a returned traveller is long, but typhoid fever and amoebic liver abscess should always be excluded because they are common and potentially life-threatening diseases. Therefore blood cultures should be taken and an abdominal ultrasound should be done. In con-trast to what was seen in this patient though, typhoid fever usually causes eosinopaenia. The further differential diagnosis of fever after a stay in tropical areas relies on the precise itinerary, the activities indulged in during travel, the presence of focal symptoms, signs and laboratory results. The patient has slightly elevated liver enzymes. The dif-ferential diagnosis of acute infections involving the liver includes viral hepatitis, including hepatitis E. EBV and CMV infections may also cause fever, elevated liver enzymes and a rise in LDH. They are important differ-entials of fever in returned travellers. However, EBV and CMV cause lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, rather than eosinophilia. Splenomegaly is usually part of the clinical picture of mononucleosis and lymphadenopathy, even though the latter can be less prominent in acute CMV infection."

This appearance is typ-ical of myiasis-the pulsating end of the larva seen contains the respiratory spiracles. The lesion was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned 2 days later for review. The maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with a pair of forceps. The remaining lesion looked clean and no further treatment was required. Myiasis Myiasis is the infestation of live humans and vertebrate animals with larvae (maggots) of flies, which feed on the host’s dead or living tissue, liquid body-substance or ingested food. It derives from the Greek word “myia” which means “fly.” Cutaneous furuncular myiasis is one of the most common travel-associated skin disorders. In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango fly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy ground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on a clothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents.",
        "Adult L. loa migrate through the subcutaneous and connective tissues of the human body. Migration may cause urticaria and transient painless subcutane-ous swellings (‘Calabar swellings’), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, which is noticed by the patient as intense itching of the eye, pain and photophobia. Passage of the palpebral conjunctiva is associated with swelling of the eyelid and the periorbital region. Loiasis may cause renal complications (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) and a wide range of neurological symptoms. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae that are detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime with a peak around noon, but are usually absent at night. This diurnal periodicity corresponds to the day-biting habits of the Chrysops vectors. Microfilaraemia in L. loa infection tends to be higher than in lymphatic filariasis, where microfilariaemia is usually betweeen 1 and 1000 mf/ml. However, there is also a high percentage of amicrofilaraemic individuals (‘occult loiasis’) in endemic areas, which poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis in loiasis relies on the typical passage of the adults through the bulbar conjunctiva (‘eye worm’).",
        "Furthermore, it deposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, flies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a technique called ‘hitch-hiking.’ Removal of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision. Additional forms of myiasis exist whereby larvae may invade various body cavities such as nasal sinuses, ears, mouth, eye, vagina or anus (body cavity myiasis). Wounds can be infested as well.",
        "In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango fly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy ground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on a clothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents. Humans become infected when lying on the ground or wearing contami-nated clothes without prior hot ironing. Larvae hatch and burrow into the skin. Over the following 2 to 3 weeks the developing larvae cause an itchy and at times painful ‘blind boil.’ Lesions are usually sterile because of bacteriostatic substances produced in the larvae’s guts. Treatment aims to deprive the larvae of oxygen, which prompts them to extrude from the skin. This can be achieved by applying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin on the lesion to block their respiratory spiracles. Immature larvae are best left to develop for a while because they are difficult to retrieve, and maceration of the larva can lead to inflammation and superinfection. Even untreated, cutaneous myiasis is self-limiting because the mature larva has to leave the host and pupate elsewhere. In Central and South America, myiasis is caused by Derma-tobia hominis, the human botfly (Fig. 8.2). Unlike the Tumbu fly, this species lays its eggs directly on exposed skin. Furthermore, it deposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, flies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a technique called ‘hitch-hiking.’ Removal of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision.",
        "The skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but may occur in any part of the body that came into contact with infested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent affected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms may invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia. Diagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history. Skin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in advance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests available, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases. The treatment of choice is ivermectin (200μg/kg for 1-2 days.). Albendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-cated or not available. Albendazole 400mg should be given twice daily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10-15% tds for 5 to 10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be difficult in multiple lesions. Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor. For prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should be dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In resource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual protection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair on the beach because towels may be covered with sand and therefore do not protect sufficiently."

Because Lassa fever is common, it should be considered in anyone with an unexplained febrile condition who has visited an endemic area within the past 21 days and appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented. It is more common in people from rural than urban areas, but it does occur in towns. Treatment with IV ribavirin is likely to be beneficial if given early in the disease, but it should also be considered in patients who are diagnosed late.

        "Her family members, close friends and medical staff were interviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her, or her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for 21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum incubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever or became unwell during this period was isolated. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are both caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-guishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate. Symptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and abdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-quent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die develop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Because symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in most of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an outbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should raise the suspicion towards FHF. EVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of MHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines, whereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating apes or monkeys.",
        "Leptospirosis can start with a non-specific febrile illness. Pulmonary involvement including haemorrhages is common and it can cause renal impairment. Patients with severe lep-tospirosis tend to present with conjunctival suffusions rather than with conjunctivitis. Typhoid can present as a non-specific febrile illness. You would expect the patient to eventually improve on ceftriax-one, but prolonged clinical courses in typhoid are not uncommon. Pharyngitis and conjunctivitis are usually not part of the clinical picture. Lassa fever is quite common in Eastern Sierra Leone, accounting for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some stud-ies. All the signs and symptoms the patient has are consistent with Lassa fever. Answer to Question 2 What Tests Would You do and How Would You Manage the Patient? Lassa fever is a serious disease. It has caused nosocomial out-breaks in which many medical staff have died. Therefore all procedures should be done with caution and the possibility 205 # Page 2 of Lassa fever should always be discussed with the laboratory. All specimens should be transported in sealed plastic containers. Serological and tests are available for the diagnosis of Lassa fever, and an antigen-based rapid point-of-care test has been licensed. PCR tests are the most sensitive but are not available in most African countries. Antigen tests demonstrate the pres-ence of the disease but may not detect low levels of the virus, especially if taken in the first days of illness.",

For more than 12 years he has suffered from recur-rent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps; the fre-quency of these episodes appears to have increased in the past 2 years. The patient originates from northern Peru but has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He reports that his Peru-vian wife and children are healthy, but that his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and subsequent death at the age of 45 and 28 years, respectively. Clinical Findings The patient is cachectic with a severe loss of muscle mass and a body weight of 44 kg (BMI 17). Apart from slight pain on abdominal palpation, the physical examination is normal: He is afebrile, liver and spleen are not enlarged, there is no palpable lymphadenopathy and no peripheral oedema. Laboratory results His laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 79.1. Other Investigations Abdominal scan and abdominal are without any pathological findings.

He reports weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence and abdominal cramping when passing stool. For the past 3 days he has had bloating and distension after intake of milk products with an urge to pass stool. He has mild nausea, but no fever. Stools were watery earlier but he went to a local pharmacy and was given ciprofloxacin, which he took for 5 days ending 2 days previously, and stools are now three or four per day, mushy, greasy and foul-smelling. Clinical Findings 33-year-old man, 180cm, 72kg (reports a 4kg weight loss), mild non-specific abdominal tenderness. No signs of dehydration. The rest of the examination is normal. Laboratory Results Stool for reducing substances: positive. Stool examination for enteric parasites: Giardia trophozoites are seen in the fresh specimen.

There was no history of trauma and no prodromal symptoms; he had been in excellent health before. The weakness in his legs rapidly progressed over 4 to 5 days, leading to him needing a cane for mobility. He had no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance or upper limb symptoms.

        "High white cell counts are commonly seen in sickle cell disease. They may be the result of bone marrow stimulation and do not necessarily indicate systemic infec-tion. However, in view of the patient’s generally poor condi-tion and the Pseudomonas grown from his wound swab, it was decided to give him systemic antibiotic treatment. Strict bed rest was difficult to enforce because the young man was self-employed and could not afford to take the required time off work. His recurrent bone pain was man-aged conservatively with good hydration, prompt treatment of infections and relief of other identifiable precipitants of crises. He received daily folic acid supplementation. Pain relief was achieved with paracetamol and tramadol. However, on follow-up 3 years later, the ulcer was still not healed. Grafting was under consideration, when healthy granulation tissue would be achieved. Six years later, the wound had still not healed and the patient could not afford a skin graft. He had 3 times weekly dressing and felt well in himself. His was normal and his Hb had slightly increased (see Table 62.1). SUMMARY BOX Leg Ulcers in Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of autosomal-codominant genetic disorders characterized by the production of abnormal sickle haemoglobin S (HbS). Homozygous HbSS leads to sickle cell anaemia, the most severe form of SCD. Sickle cell disease is the commonest hereditary haematological disorder.",
        "The skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but may occur in any part of the body that came into contact with infested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent affected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms may invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia. Diagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history. Skin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in advance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests available, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases. The treatment of choice is ivermectin (200μg/kg for 1-2 days.). Albendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-cated or not available. Albendazole 400mg should be given twice daily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10-15% tds for 5 to 10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be difficult in multiple lesions. Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor. For prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should be dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In resource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual protection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair on the beach because towels may be covered with sand and therefore do not protect sufficiently."

        "Other causes of severe anaemia, such as iron deficiency, helminth infections and malaria, are less common in an HIV-positive urban adult population but may have to be considered in other patients, in particular children, pregnant women or in the rural poor. Thalassaemia usually leads to a microcytic anaemia. Severe anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients commonly present to healthcare facilities late, at times only when they are developing heart failure secondary to severe anaemia. Visceral leishmaniasis may also cause fever and pancyto-penia as seen in this patient. It usually causes gross hepatos-plenomegaly which our patient does not have. It also appears not to be endemic in Malawi, but should be considered in other parts of Africa, e.g. South Sudan, Northern Uganda and Northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage This Patient? Fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started immediately. Before starting antibiotic treatment, blood cul-tures should be taken. Because bacteraemia may be low, it is important to inoculate a decent volume of blood (at least 20-40ml) for culture. Severe anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a sign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for underlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdom-inal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is <100 cells/μl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) may also help confirm TB.",

        "The skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but may occur in any part of the body that came into contact with infested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent affected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms may invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia. Diagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history. Skin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in advance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests available, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases. The treatment of choice is ivermectin (200μg/kg for 1-2 days.). Albendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-cated or not available. Albendazole 400mg should be given twice daily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10-15% tds for 5 to 10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be difficult in multiple lesions. Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor. For prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should be dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In resource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual protection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair on the beach because towels may be covered with sand and therefore do not protect sufficiently.",

He thinks he might have been bitten on his ankle by a tick 2 days previously while out walk-ing in the countryside. Twenty-four hours after this event he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on the inside of his left ankle and this was accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He went to a clinic where a blood film for malaria parasites was reported negative. He was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a wide-spread itchy rash and shortly afterwards became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint. There was a family history of allergy. He had kept bees in the United Kingdom and had frequently been stung without ill effect. However, 9 months previously he had been bitten by insects while at Lake Malawi and had developed an asthmatic attack which resolved spontaneously over 2 days.

This immunological imbalance affects the Th2-mediated control of S. stercoralis, with the risk of accelerated auto-infection leading to increased loads of Stron-gyloides adults and larvae. In HIV/AIDS, T-cell response is shifted towards Th2 cytokines; therefore HIV infection is not usually associated with strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, even though some cases have been described, e.g. in the context of immune reconstitution inflam-matory syndrome (IRIS). HTLV-1-associated S. stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome mostly presents as severe chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, and wasting. Disseminated forms, which are characterized by inva-sion of extraintestinal tissues (apart from the lung passage of larvae), a more rapid progress and a high lethality, are more typically found in patients under corticosteroid therapy. Because patients with hyperinfection lack common hallmarks of strongy-loidiasis, such as eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels, diagnosis is often delayed or missed. The drug of choice for patients with strongyloides hyperin-fection syndrome is ivermectin given over prolonged periods of time (e.g. 7 days for two or more cycles).

SUMMARY BOX Eosinophilic Meningitis Eosinophilic meningitis is defined as the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microlitre of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count. Invasion of the central nervous system by the food-borne nematodes Angiostrongylus cantonensis, and less frequently, Gnathos-toma spinigerum, are the most common causes (Table 64.2). Rarely, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, paragoni-miasis, fascioliasis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis and trichinel-losis can be associated with eosinophilic meningitis; however, the meningeal involvement is usually not prominent. Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the rat lungworm, is the most common infectious cause of eosinophilic meningitis. Humans are infected by ingestion of Angiostrongylus larvae in interme-diate hosts such as fresh water snails and slugs; or transport (paratenic) hosts, such as prawns, crabs and frogs; or salad and vegetables contaminated with slime of infected snails. Once ingested, the third stage larvae (L3) penetrate the intes-tinal wall, reach the portal vein and from there enter the systemic circulation.",

In patients with disseminated infection, initial treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (3-5mg/kg daily) is highly effective. Itraconazole (400mg daily) is favoured for maintenance ther-apy. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of infection and the immune status of the patient. IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) guidelines recommends 6 to 18 months in total.",

Most patients recover sponta-neously after 2 to 10 weeks. Rarely, neurological complications can occur, e.g. transverse myelitis, conus medullaris or cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis of acute schistosomiasis can be challenging. Schistosoma ova (Fig. 20.2) may still be absent from urine or stool at this early stage and serological tests can take up to 3 months to become positive. As a consequence, these investigations have to be repeated several times after the diagnosis has been clinically suspected. PCR-based methods are promising for the diagnosis of acute Schistosoma infection in recently primarily exposed populations such as travellers. Praziquantel has a lack of activity against immature flukes and severe reactions have been reported after praziquantel treatment during the acute phase. Therefore antiparasitic treatment should be delayed until the flukes are adult, i.e. until eggs can be detected in stool or urine. Under certain circumstances, such as severe symptoms and in particular neurological complications, supportive steroid ther-apy may be useful in Katayama syndrome. Of note, different stages of the parasite life cycle may overlap in a patient who is infected with many schistosomules."

His problem started 10 years ago, when he woke from sleep one morning and noticed weakness in both legs. There was no history of trauma and no prodromal symptoms; he had been in excellent health before. The weakness in his legs rapidly progressed over 4 to 5 days, leading to him needing a cane for mobility. He had no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance or upper limb symptoms. The start of his illness coincided with a period of drought and famine, when his diet almost exclusively consisted of grass peas (Lathyrus sativus, local name guaya), which is known to be drought-resistant (Fig. 69.1). Despite the monotonous diet, he had been engaged in hard physical labour on his family farm, where he was the main breadwin-ner, despite his young age. He lived with his mother and three sisters, who took care of household chores; they con-sumed a similar diet but of overall smaller amounts of guaya. During that time, several similar cases of weakness among young male farmers occurred in his village. His walking dif-ficulty finally meant that he could not return to farm work. At the age of 20, he moved to the capital city seeking an alter-native job. He migrated along with another young male farmer from his village who had suffered a similar fate; he had weakness of both legs and arms, which he had developed during the same period of drought.",

It is widely prevalent in Africa, Asia and Latin America and is considered by the WHO to be the most common preventable cause of epilepsy in the developing world. Humans acquire neurocysticercosis by eating food, e.g. salad or vegetables, contaminated with T. solium eggs. This explains why even individuals who do not eat pork meat for religious or ideological reasons can get neurocysticercosis, as seen in this case. (Consuming infested pork meat leads to intestinal infection with adult pork tapeworm). Consumed ova release oncospheres that penetrate the intestinal wall to spread haematogenously throughout the host’s body. In the CNS they become encysted affecting either the CNS parenchyma or, less commonly, the subarachnoid space. Symptoms and signs depend on the location of cysts. The most common clinical presentation is focal epileptic seizures. Cysts in the subarachnoid space can cause hydrocephalus, producing headache and altered mental state. Diagnosis is based on neuroimaging, serology and epidemiological evidence. Only vesicular and colloidal cysts are amenable to anthelmintic treatment (Table 38.1)."

Treatment with antibiotics and nutritional support can prevent disease pro-gression and save the child’s life. Survivors suffer with disfigure-ment, functional impairment and psychosocial isolation. Noma is an indicator of extreme poverty and inadequate public health systems. The elimination of extreme poverty, provision of prenatal care, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, immunizations, food security and improved nutrition for the poorest children can lead to the eradication of this preventable childhood disease.",

He had been well until just over 2 years earlier when his illness suddenly started. He describes that he was walking home from school when he first noticed that his legs began to feel heavy and started to tremble, which caused him difficulty in walking, with a tendency to fall over. He slowly completed the jour-ney home; and since that day, he has been unable to stand or walk unaided. He now stands on his toes and drags his legs around with the aid of a stick (Fig. 24.1).

His face healed with contractures, resulting in disfigurement and salivary incontinence. At age 9 years, he was referred for surgery by a visiting international surgical team. After two surgeries, his appearance was improved, and the salivary incontinence corrected (Fig. 5.2). Noma Noma is an opportunistic infection, primarily affecting children aged 1 to 7 years, whose immunity is compromised by malnu-trition and vitamin deficiencies. Risk factors include extreme poverty, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, viral infections (especially measles and HIV), poor sanitation and living in close proximity to livestock. The true aetiology of noma is unknown. The patho-genesis appears to be a complex combination of factors, including poverty, poor oral hygiene facilitating necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, malnutrition and infectious diseases such as malaria and measles leading to impaired immunity."

        "SUMMARY BOX Giardiasis Giardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis (also called G. lamblia), a flagellate protozoan. The parasite is present throughout the world, with several species found in animals. Not all infections result in symptoms, particularly in tropical countries where local populations with constant exposure rarely develop disease. Symptomatic giardiasis is common in travellers to regions of South and South-east Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, particularly where clean water supplies and standards of food hygiene are low. Giardia trophozoites are found in the small intestine of humans, and these non-invasive parasites appear to cause diarrhoea by blocking the absorptive surfaces of the gut and possibly by inducing fluid secretion. The trophozoites produce an environmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool and enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel movements. The most common method of infection is by drinking contaminated water. However, people may also become infected through hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating contaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and unknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of giardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symp-toms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps, gas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The symptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer. Giardiasis can cause malabsorption of vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron, fat and carbohydrates in up to 20-40% of patients.",
        "Diarrhoea caused by small intestinal infection is typically high volume, watery and often associated with malabsorption and dehydration. Colonic involvement is more often associated with frequent small-volume stools, the presence of blood and a sensation of urgency. Chronic diarrhoea or recurrent episodes of acute diarrhoea should prompt testing. Answer to Question 2 What Complications Can Result from an Acute Enteric Infection? Common complications of acute enteric infections are shown in Table 49.2. CHAPTER 49 A 33-Year-Old Male Traveller to India With Diarrhoea and Flatulence for Two Weeks # Page 3 The Case Continued… The patient was given tinidazole 2g as a single oral dose. He was advised to restrict milk and high sugar products for a period of 2 weeks. He was counselled on food and water safety when travelling and was asked to return after 3 days. On review, he stated that his stool consistency had returned to normal and the frequency had decreased, he had no nausea and his anorexia had decreased. He had eaten a local dessert the previous day without realizing that it was made of reduced milk and had experienced some bloating and dis-comfort, but was otherwise feeling much better.

        "Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environ-mental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums where basic infrastructure is not available and rural and urban areas in endemic countries where sanitation is limited, including refugee camps. Additionally, natural disasters, as well as times of political and social unrest associated with a collapse of infrastructure, pose a risk of cholera. An outbreak is defined as the occurrence of disease epi-sodes in greater numbers than would be expected at a partic-ular time and place. In this case there seems to be a typical cholera outbreak. The source is most probably contaminated water consumed from the containers during the festival, with the likelihood that unless control measures for disease prevention and appropriate case management are instituted rapidly, there will be spread, significant morbidity and, possibly, mortality. Answer to Question 2 How is Dehydration Assessed and Managed? The WHO has recommended an assessment based on the general clinical condition of the patient (Table 14.2). Depending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are assigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration or intravenous rehydration (Table 14.3). Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement are the corner-stones of cholera management and differ substantially from the approaches to patients with gastroenteritis of other aeti-ologies. Patients with severe cholera present with a higher CHAPTER 14 A 22-Year-Old Woman from Bangladesh With Profuse Watery Diarrhoea # Page 3 degree of initial dehydration, have more rapid continuing losses and proportionately greater electrolyte depletion than patients with other forms of gastroenteritis.",
        "This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process. Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely. Localized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles or abscesses are very com-mon among backpacking travellers. hot and humid tropical climate combined with low standards of hygiene favour bac-terial and fungal skin infections. Itchy mosquito bites may serve as a portal of entry. Bacterial spread often occurs via scratching or contaminated items such as towels and shavers. Another important differential diagnosis in this case is an infestation with fly maggots (myiasis). The slow growth of the boil, the absence of lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms as well as the localized itch make myiasis the most likely differential diagnosis.

In infectious hepatitis one would expect higher transaminase levels and clinical jaundice. The most likely diagnosis in this man is a liver abscess, which could be amoebic or pyogenic. Given the Asian set-ting, hyermucoviscous serotypes of Klebisella pneumoniae have to be considered which have been increasingly detected in South and South East Asia since around 1990 and also seem to be spreading to countries outside Asia. Given the epidemiological setting, the relatively young age of the patient and the absence of comorbidities such as diabetes or biliary disease, an amoebic liver abscess is more likely. Also, the alcoholic drink the patient con-sumes is locally known to be linked with amoebiasis. The precise mechanisms are still under discussion; it is assumed that the parasites contaminate the clay containers used to collect toddy, but additional factors may play a role as well. Another tropical infectious disease to consider in a febrile patient from Asia with any kind of organ abscess is melioidosis. Melioidosis, caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, can also present with pulmonary infiltrates and cavities similar to TB, as septic arthritis, with skin manifestations and with cerebral involvement.",
        "Infection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific febrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history of diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild splenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients, hepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with iNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection, with pathogens such as M. tuberculosis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection. Blood culture remains the diagnostic standard; however, it is not widely available in many African settings. Also, sensitivity of blood culture is suboptimal because of the low magnitude of bacteraemia (median <1 CFU/mL). Care should therefore be taken to inoculate large enough volumes of blood for culture. Antimicrobial resistance among iNTS strains in Africa is increasing. Empirical management is similar to enteric fever and includes either a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, depending on the local resistance pattern and drug availability. If oral intake is not possible, a third-generation cephalosporin should be administered. Effective antibiotic treatment should be given for 10 to 14 days. Antiretroviral therapy should be started urgently to prevent relapse. The case fatality rate of patients with iNTS is much higher than in enteric fever (22-47% vs 1%).",
        "Recently, multiplex PCR testing on aspirated fluid has been identified as a rapid and robust diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess in patients with cystic focal liver lesions. Stool microscopy for E. histolytica trophozoites may be attempted but is less than 50% sensitive. The Case Continued… The ultrasound scan of his abdomen revealed a solitary hypoechoic lesion with an irregular wall measuring 76cm in the right liver lobe. There was a small pleural effusion on the right. Because of its large size, the lesion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance, yielding brownish pus highly suspi-cious of an amoebic liver abscess. The patient was treated with metronidazole for ten days and made a rapid and uneventful recovery. SUMMARY BOX Amoebic Liver Abscess Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common extraintestinal form of invasive amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica. The infection occurs worldwide but is most common in tropical areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation. Rates of ALA are 3 to 20 times higher in men between 18 and 50 years of age than in other populations; the reasons for this are poorly understood but hormonal factors are being discussed, as well as alcohol consumption. Humans acquire the infection by ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water. Trophozoites of E. histolytica may penetrate the intestinal wall and haematogenously spread to the liver.",

She tried analgesics, which did not control the pain. She also reports intermittent fevers for the past 2 weeks. Three days previously, she was seen at the emergency room of the same hospital for the above-mentioned com-plaints. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in her liver. She was treated with ceftriaxone and met-ronidazole for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses but did not show any clinical improvement.

Less common findings include changes in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hepato-megaly, splenomegaly, ascites, anaemia and jaundice. Eosin-ophilia is almost always present during the acute phase. At the beginning of the subsequent latent phase the para-sites have crossed the liver parenchyma to finally reach the common bile duct, where they mature and start depositing eggs.

        "# Page 12935-Year-Old Woman from Malawi With Fever and Severe Anaemia Clinical Presentation History 35-year-old Malawian woman presents to a local hospital because of fever and weakness. The fever started 3 days earlier, but the weakness has pro-gressed over the past several months. There is no cough and no night sweats, but she reports some weight loss. There is no diarrhoea, no dysuria and no history of abnormal bleeds. Two months earlier she presented to a local health centre because of her weakness. She was found to be clinically pale and was prescribed iron tablets, which she took. Neverthe-less, the weakness progressed. Otherwise, the patient does not report any abnormalities. She is divorced, with three children (17, 15 and 12 years old), who are all well. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables on the local market. The family can afford three meals a day and occasionally meat or fish. Clinical Findings 35-year-old woman, wasted, body mass index 17kg/m2. Blood pressure 90/60mmHg (difficult to measure because of the low upper arm circumference), pulse 110bpm, tem-perature 37.8°C (100°F), respiratory rate 25 breath cycles per minute, oxygen saturation 97% on ambient air, Glasgow Coma Scale 15/15. Her conjunctivae are very pale, but there is no jaundice. The examination of her mouth is normal, there is no oral thrush, no Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions and no oral hairy leuko-plakia.",
        "This is a very common clinical scenario in a high-prevalence setting for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Answer to Question 1 What is the Suspected Diagnosis? The patient presents with a septic picture without a clear focus; she is newly diagnosed HIV-positive and her wasting and anaemia suggest advanced immunosuppression and/or possible concomitant tuberculosis (TB). The most common cause of sepsis in HIV-positive adults in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa is infection with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS). The slight abdominal tenderness and her splenomegaly would also fit with this diagnosis. Enteric fevers (typhoid or paratyphoid) are clinically indistinguishable from infection with iNTS, they are # Page 2 however far less common than iNTS in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The reason for this is unclear. Severe anaemia led to the non-specific feeling of progres-sive ‘weakness’ in this patient. It is most likely a consequence of infection of her bone marrow with HIV, Salmonellae and possibly also with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other causes of severe anaemia, such as iron deficiency, helminth infections and malaria, are less common in an HIV-positive urban adult population but may have to be considered in other patients, in particular children, pregnant women or in the rural poor. Thalassaemia usually leads to a microcytic anaemia. Severe anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa.",
        "Severe anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a sign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for underlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdom-inal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is <100 cells/μl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) may also help confirm TB. Of note, anaemia may be the only finding in a patient with TB hiding in the bone marrow; and even if all routine investigations are unremarkable, TB should still be high on the list of possible diagnoses if the patient does not make a satisfactory recovery, i.e. remains febrile and/or anaemic or continues to lose weight. The baseline CD4 count should be checked and the patient should be started on co-trimoxazole preventive treatment as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started as soon as possible, once the acute infection is under control and concomitant opportunistic infections have been ruled out. The latter is important to pre-vent unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syn-drome (IRIS). Her children and her current and past sexual partners should be encouraged to go for an HIV test. The Case Continued… Blood cultures were taken and the patient was started on IV ceftriaxone 2 g od, as well as on fluid resuscitation.",
        "Her family members, close friends and medical staff were interviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her, or her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for 21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum incubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever or became unwell during this period was isolated. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are both caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-guishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate. Symptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and abdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-quent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die develop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Because symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in most of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an outbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should raise the suspicion towards FHF. EVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of MHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines, whereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating apes or monkeys."

The most com-mon error is for clinicians to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required for rehydration. Up to 80% of sufferers can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration salts (WHO/ UNICEF ORS standard sachets). In adults, 2 to 4 litres of ORS may be required in the first 4 hours. Patients with severe cholera typically require an average of 200mL/kg of isotonic oral or IV fluids in the first 24 hours (Table 14.2). The initial fluid deficit should be replaced within 3 to 4 hours of initial presentation. 10 to 20mL/kg bodyweight should be calculated for each diarrhoeal stool or episode of vomiting. Antibiotic therapy in cholera is secondary; but in patients with severe disease, appropriate antibiotics diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excre-tion. In Bangladesh, resistance to furazolidone and tetracy-cline is increasing.

        "Adult L. loa migrate through the subcutaneous and connective tissues of the human body. Migration may cause urticaria and transient painless subcutane-ous swellings (‘Calabar swellings’), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, which is noticed by the patient as intense itching of the eye, pain and photophobia. Passage of the palpebral conjunctiva is associated with swelling of the eyelid and the periorbital region. Loiasis may cause renal complications (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) and a wide range of neurological symptoms. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae that are detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime with a peak around noon, but are usually absent at night. This diurnal periodicity corresponds to the day-biting habits of the Chrysops vectors. Microfilaraemia in L. loa infection tends to be higher than in lymphatic filariasis, where microfilariaemia is usually betweeen 1 and 1000 mf/ml. However, there is also a high percentage of amicrofilaraemic individuals (‘occult loiasis’) in endemic areas, which poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis in loiasis relies on the typical passage of the adults through the bulbar conjunctiva (‘eye worm’).",

        "Complications in measles are much more common in indi-viduals with cellular immune defects than in the immuno-competent. Severe diarrhoea, septicaemia, giant cell pneumonia, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, encephali-tis, otitis media and corneal ulcerations can complicate the course of disease. In this case, with a reduced Blantyre Coma Scale and laboured breathing, encephalitis and pulmonary involvement have to be considered. Because the rash in this boy has only just appeared, he is still contagious and needs to be isolated and nursed in a separate room. 85 # Page 2 The Case Continued… The boy required fluids, and vitamin was given for cor-neal protection. Malaria treatment was stopped as smears turned out to be negative. Within the next 3 days, the rash covered the trunk and skin scaling started over the chest (Fig. 31.1). The boy developed severe pneumonia and received antibiotic treatment. After recovery, antiretroviral therapy was started in the out-patient-clinic. Measles Measles is a highly contagious viral infection, caused by a para-myxovirus and transmitted through droplets. The course of the disease is strongly influenced by both nutritional and immune status of the affected individual. Despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, large measles outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. After an incu-bation period of 8 to 12 days, the non-specific prodromal stage presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and cough, followed after a few days by a maculopapular rash, evolving behind the ears and in the face, spreading over the trunk and limbs."

Dengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these methods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral blood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed, (at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however, cross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, espe-cially in Zika endemic areas. Warning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increas-ing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytope-nia, six of which were present in this case.

The reason for the enlargement of his kidneys could either be primary (e.g. polycystic kidneys) or secondary as a result of post-renal obstruction with hydronephrosis.

Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach This Patient? Blood cultures should be taken in any febrile patient regard-less of the malaria test result to rule out bacterial sepsis and enteric fever. Her test should be repeated. Since she is symptomatic and has malaria parasites in her blood, she should receive antimalarials according to the national guidelines and the local resistance profile. She should also be given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for Gram-negative and, less likely, Gram-positive bacteria. A urinary dipstick could quickly help rule out a urinary tract infection. An abdominal ultrasound should be done to rule out post-hepatic causes of jaundice and to assess texture and size of liver and spleen.

        "Her family members, close friends and medical staff were interviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her, or her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for 21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum incubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever or became unwell during this period was isolated. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are both caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-guishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate. Symptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and abdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-quent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die develop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Because symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in most of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an outbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should raise the suspicion towards FHF. EVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of MHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines, whereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating apes or monkeys.",
        "The differential diagnosis is wide, but by some distance the most common cause of fever and jaundice or fever and con-fusion in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. The fact that the patient had a low-grade fever at presentation is not a reason to exclude malaria, because the temperature swings in malaria and a significant proportion of cases are apyrexial at presentation. common misdiagnosis is acute viral hepatitis; there, fever precedes the jaundice, and this rapid fulminant course would not be typical. Other causes of acute fever and jaundice include typhoid fever, leptospirosis and ascending cholangitis. Patients with advanced disease and Gram-negative sepsis can also present like this.

Answer to Question 2 Is Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (VHF) a Real Risk, and which Single Test is Most Important? The laboratory is right to raise VHF as a possible diagnosis, but VHF is very rare and 18 days (or more) since leaving the high-risk area is on the outer limit of the incubation period of Lassa fever and other VHF (generally up to 21 days). The absence of injected sclerae or rash is also against the diagno-sis. A malaria blood film would be mandatory in this case.",

There is a localized swelling with a central scab. This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process. Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely.",
        "Given the clinical syndrome of fever, retro-orbital pain, arthralgias and thrombocytopenia after a visit to Thailand, the most likely differential diagnosis to suspect is dengue fever. Dengue is the most common febrile tropical disease seen in returning travellers from South and South-east Asia. The duration of fever, however, is borderline long for den-gue. The dengue NS1 antigen test reflecting dengue viraemia may already be negative at day 6 and does not reliably rule out the infection. Chikungunya and Zika are additional important arboviral infections to suspect. Influenza is another important differential diagnosis to have in this patient. Fever and associated symptoms are usu-ally of shorter duration but may last as long as 8 days. Acute HIV infection may present with persistent fever and throm-bocytopenia, and possible exposures should definitely be inquired. Enteric fever presents with persistent febrile tem-peratures and otherwise non-specific symptoms. Because food hygiene in Thailand is overall very good, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are nowadays rarely seen imported from 256 # Page 2 this country. Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile trav-eller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocyto-penia also being a hallmark feature. Malaria is nowadays rarely seen in travellers returning from Thailand; however, overlooking it could be lethal. A negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out malaria because RDTs are of unsatisfactory sensitivity for diagnosis of non-falciparum malaria.",

Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely. Localized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles or abscesses are very com-mon among backpacking travellers. hot and humid tropical climate combined with low standards of hygiene favour bac-terial and fungal skin infections. Itchy mosquito bites may serve as a portal of entry. Bacterial spread often occurs via scratching or contaminated items such as towels and shavers. Another important differential diagnosis in this case is an infestation with fly maggots (myiasis). The slow growth of the boil, the absence of lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms as well as the localized itch make myiasis the most likely differential diagnosis.

There is a localized swelling with a central scab. This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process. Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely.",

Its epidemiology has long been considered limited to the Asia-Pacific area but in 2016 was also first described in patients from South America. Scrub typhus belongs to the tropical rickettsial infections and is caused by O. tsutsugamushi. The infection is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. Infected mite larvae are found in a wide variety of habitats, from scrubs and primary forests to gardens, beaches, bamboo fields and oil palm or rubber estates.

With a story of possible tick bite, a positive family history of allergy, a history of bee keeping, an asthmatic episode after insect bites 9 months previously in addition to the dramatic clinical presentation of urticarial rash and anaphylactic shock, the initial diagnosis was of a possible hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite.",
        "Adult L. loa migrate through the subcutaneous and connective tissues of the human body. Migration may cause urticaria and transient painless subcutane-ous swellings (‘Calabar swellings’), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, which is noticed by the patient as intense itching of the eye, pain and photophobia. Passage of the palpebral conjunctiva is associated with swelling of the eyelid and the periorbital region. Loiasis may cause renal complications (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) and a wide range of neurological symptoms. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae that are detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime with a peak around noon, but are usually absent at night. This diurnal periodicity corresponds to the day-biting habits of the Chrysops vectors. Microfilaraemia in L. loa infection tends to be higher than in lymphatic filariasis, where microfilariaemia is usually betweeen 1 and 1000 mf/ml. However, there is also a high percentage of amicrofilaraemic individuals (‘occult loiasis’) in endemic areas, which poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis in loiasis relies on the typical passage of the adults through the bulbar conjunctiva (‘eye worm’)."

        "Her family members, close friends and medical staff were interviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her, or her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for 21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum incubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever or became unwell during this period was isolated. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are both caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-guishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate. Symptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and abdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-quent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die develop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Because symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in most of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an outbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should raise the suspicion towards FHF. EVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of MHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines, whereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating apes or monkeys.",

        "Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses and Which Investigations Would You Like to Do? The patient has travelled in Mozambique without taking any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Thus first of all malaria has to be excluded-irrespective of any other symptoms or lab-oratory results. The differential diagnosis of pyrexia in a returned traveller is long, but typhoid fever and amoebic liver abscess should always be excluded because they are common and potentially life-threatening diseases. Therefore blood cultures should be taken and an abdominal ultrasound should be done. In con-trast to what was seen in this patient though, typhoid fever usually causes eosinopaenia. The further differential diagnosis of fever after a stay in tropical areas relies on the precise itinerary, the activities indulged in during travel, the presence of focal symptoms, signs and laboratory results. The patient has slightly elevated liver enzymes. The dif-ferential diagnosis of acute infections involving the liver includes viral hepatitis, including hepatitis E. EBV and CMV infections may also cause fever, elevated liver enzymes and a rise in LDH. They are important differ-entials of fever in returned travellers. However, EBV and CMV cause lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, rather than eosinophilia. Splenomegaly is usually part of the clinical picture of mononucleosis and lymphadenopathy, even though the latter can be less prominent in acute CMV infection.",
        "In any febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region, malaria has to be ruled out, even if other diagnoses seem obvious. The diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is primarily clinical. 149 # Page 2 from the eschar scab may confirm the diagnosis. For confirmative serology, paired samples would have to be taken and may be more of academic value in this case. Afri-can tick-bite fever is usually a mild, self-limiting disease. Doxycycline can be given to speed up recovery. The Case Continued… The malaria rapid diagnostic test, as well as thick and thin film for malaria, came back negative. The patient was pre-scribed doxycycline at 100mg bid for 1 week. The fever settled within the next few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after about 2 weeks. SUMMARY BOX African Tick-Bite Fever African tick-bite fever (ATBF) is the second most common specific cause of fever after malaria in travellers returning from sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the spotted fever group of rickettsioses, a large group of infections, which are mainly transmitted by ticks. An overview of rickettsial infections and their vectors is given in Table 54.1. ATBF is caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by cattle ticks of the genus Amblyomma, which act both as reservoir and as vector. Other reservoir hosts are wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, buffalos, rhinos, and hippos."

        "No clinical laboratory data were available because, for biosafety reasons, such testing was suspended. Although it is a reasonable precaution, the suspension of routine testing often causes difficulty in ruling out the many other febrile syn-dromes in the differential diagnosis and increases mortality from other non-Ebola disease. Fortunately, many clinical lab-oratory tests can now be safely performed with point-of-care instruments, often brought into a specialized laboratory in the isolation ward, as long as the laboratory personnel are properly trained and equipped. Answer to Question 1 Is the Patient’s History and Clinical Presentation Consistent with an Syndrome? The clinical presentation is indeed one of classic viral However, most times the diagnosis is not so easy. Although some patients, such as this one, do progress to the classic syn-drome with haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syn-drome and shock, haemorrhage is not invariably seen (and may even be noted in only a minority of cases with some virus species), and severe and fatal disease may still occur in its absence. The clinical presentation of viral is often very non-specific. Furthermore, haemorrhage may be seen in numerous other syndromes, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis and leptospirosis, which are the primary differential diagnoses, depending on the region. Answer to Question 2 What Degree of Nursing Precautions Needs to be Implemented? The spread of Ebola virus between humans is through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. Secondary attack rates are generally 15% to 20% during outbreaks in Africa, and much lower if proper universal precautions are maintained.",

She is hypotensive and has bilateral con-junctivitis. Her husband has recently died after a short febrile illness. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The presentation is non-specific and a wide range of acute infectious diseases are possible. Both malaria and typhoid fever present with non-specific symptoms and a septic picture, but neither would cause con-junctivitis. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, including inva-sive meningococcal disease have to be considered. severe viral infection with an adenovirus or influenza would be possible but the patient appears slightly too unwell for this. Measles commonly presents with pronounced con-junctivitis, but at this stage one would see a rash. Zika virus was discovered in Uganda and presents with conjunctivitis, but usually is a mild viral illness and does not cause shock. The fact that the patient’s husband has recently died of a similar severe febrile illness should raise the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). Marburg virus disease (MVD) has been associated with mines. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach the Patient and What Tests Would You Do? The patient should be treated with extreme caution because of the possibility of a viral haemorrhagic fever.

        "# Page 12043-Year-Old Male Traveller Returning from Mozambique With Fever and Eosinophilia Clinical Presentation History 43-year-old German man presents to a local travel clinic on 21 May because of fever. He had been in Mozambique from 16 April to 30 April, and travelled to Chile afterwards from 30 April to 17 May. He did not take any malaria chemopro-phylaxis in Mozambique and reports self-treatment for malaria with atovaquone/proguanil because of fever (27 April to 29 April). He is now complaining of recurrent fever for the past 3 days. The day before presentation his temperature was as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F). He also has some headache and diarrhoea. He reports freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo. His past medical history is unremarkable. Clinical Findings 43-year-old male, febrile, with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). The rest of the physical examination is normal and there is no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly and no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory Results The relevant laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 20.1. Further Investigations Electrocardiogram is normal. Chest radiography reveals some nodular lesions ranging in size from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones bilaterally (Fig. 20.1); this finding is confirmed by a scan of his chest. # Page 2 Questions 1.",
        "# Page 1826-Year-Old Female Traveller Returning from Ghana With a Boil on the Leg Clinical Presentation History 26-year-old German student presents to the clinic because of a localized swelling on her left leg. She has just returned from a 6-week trip to Ghana. The swelling has developed slowly over the past 3 weeks. It is itchy, but not painful. There is no history of fever; no history of arthropod bites. The patient is otherwise fine. Clinical Findings There is localized swelling on the left leg, about 1.5cm in diameter (Fig. 8.1). The skin surrounding the swelling is slightly hyperaemic. The boil is covered by a blackish scab. There is no lymphadenopathy. The patient is afebrile while the rest of the physical examination is normal. Questions 1. What are your most important differential diagnoses? 2. How would you approach this patient? Discussion young traveller presents with a localized swelling on her leg after backpacking in Ghana. The swelling has been growing slowly and there are no systemic signs or symptoms. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Most Important Differential Diagnoses? There is a localized swelling with a central scab. This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process. Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely.",

Questions 1. What is the diagnosis? 2. How would you manage this patient? Discussion 52-year-old German man presents with a short history of fever after a trip to South Africa. On examination there is a small necrotic skin lesion on his upper thigh with adjoining lymphangiitis and lymphadenitis. Answer to Question 1 What is the Diagnosis? The skin lesion is a typical eschar. Given the travel history, the clinical diagnosis is most likely African tick-bite fever. This rickettsial disease is a common cause of fever in safari tourists returning from Southern Africa. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage This Patient? The patient has travelled to KwaZulu-Natal, which is a malaria-endemic region, and he has not taken any antimalar-ial chemoprophylaxis. In any febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region, malaria has to be ruled out, even if other diagnoses seem obvious. The diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is primarily clinical. 149 # Page 2 from the eschar scab may confirm the diagnosis. For confirmative serology, paired samples would have to be taken and may be more of academic value in this case.",
        "A history of fever is usual in non-immune patients, but other features of the presentation are non-specific and overlap with many other infections, with headache and malaise. Malaria should always be high on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics, because there are many misleading presentations. The only way to exclude malaria is a malaria blood test. Diagnosed early before complications begin, falciparum malaria is relatively easily treated with antimalarial drug combinations. In patients with severe malaria, artesunate is the drug of choice; if this is not available locally, artemether or quinine are the alternatives. In adults, cerebral malaria (for practical purposes altered consciousness, seizures), acute renal failure and pulmonary oedema or ARDS are the most common manifestations of severity, and may occur together or in any combination. Renal failure, and in particular ARDS, often presents later in treatment, and may first become apparent after all parasites have cleared. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock (often with co-existing bacteraemia) are rare complications. Elderly patients have a high mortality. Various adjunctive treatments for malaria complications have been tried but to date none shows survival advantage. The key to malaria management is to diagnose it early and get effective antimalarial drugs into the patient as soon as possible.",
        "Discussion Six days after returning from a 2-week holiday to Guate-mala and El Salvador, a 51-year-old female Swiss traveller presents with a slightly pruritic disseminated maculo-papular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees and feet) and a generalized lym-phadenopathy. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arbo-viral infection, which is also in line with the putative incu-bation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chi-kungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much 214 # Page 2 of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduc-tion, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years. Acute dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections have similar presentations and may be clinically indistinguishable. However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1)."
